<p>Master your brand messaging and craft flawless, compelling sales copy. Learn how to incorporate your brand message into ads, email, and more.</p>
<p>Sales copy without a brand messaging framework is like a house without a foundation. It might look pretty, but it’s not going to get the job done.</p>
<p>Just “winging it” isn’t going to cut it. You need a purpose. You need a plan. And you need excellent brand messaging.</p>
<p>As a marketing copywriter, I’ve compiled years of testing what works and what doesn’t – and I can tell you, mastering your message holds the key to your campaign performance, whether it’s an ad, email, or social post.</p>
<p>Here’s how to apply your brand messaging to sales copy, increasing sales, engagement, and customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Before you can think about how to apply your messaging to your sales copy, you need to actually define your messaging. That is, what your brand stands for, who it’s trying to reach, and how you position your brand in your market.</p>
<p>Mastering your message is its own process, which is why I developed a complete framework to follow.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the guide on How to Master Your Brand Message to get started.</p>
<p>That process involves:</p>
<p>While those steps can be a lot to take in, they set the foundation for creating a powerful, cohesive brand message. Then (and only then) can you put these insights into action.</p>
<p>Once you feel confident in your brand positioning and core messaging, you’re ready to get writing.</p>
<p>The following steps will help you apply your brand messaging in a meaningful way, resulting in better sales copy, results, and performance.</p>
<p>Using the insights and data you gathered during your market research, create a brand guidebook that puts some parameters around what you say (or don’t say) as a brand.</p>
<p>A brand guidebook is also the place to recap your brand story, key services offered (and benefits of each), audience profiles, and brand vision statement.</p>
<p>Consolidating this information in one place gives your company one source of truth for referencing your brand messaging.</p>
<p>It will serve as the reference point for all sales copy, whether written by you, your team, or a copywriter, ensuring consistency across every platform.</p>
<p>I really love this example from the Colorado School of Mines (an unlikely place), as it clearly articulates the school’s personality, story pillars, brand tenets, and tone of voice.</p>
<p>Use the insights you gathered from your market research to craft sales copy that resonates with how your audience talks, searches, and buys.</p>
<p>If you have key phrases you can pull from your audience research, that’s best. You will want to weave these phrases, whether pertaining to their needs, pain points, purchasing habits, etc., into your brand copy.</p>
<p>For example, your research reveals that your audience often searches for “affordable” skincare and products for “sensitive skin.”</p>
<p>In your web copy, you could describe your products as being “suited for sensitive skin” and an “affordable alternative to luxury skincare brands.”</p>
<p>That way, you use the exact terms your prospective customers use to search for products like yours.</p>
<p>There might be other ways to weave these insights into your messaging, like:</p>
<p>As you can see, while the content type and topic differ, the core messaging remains the same. The messaging connects exactly to what your audience told you they care about. This establishes a thread of consistency, from user to product to value to point of sale.</p>
<p>Whether you’re writing a blog post, creating a social media update, or producing a video, your audience is always at the center of your message.</p>
<p>Know the features and benefits of every product you offer so you can talk about them the exact same way, no matter where you’re advertising.</p>
<p>The features tell your audience what your product is, while the benefits show them why it’s valuable. This is a matter of consistency as well as just a great sales technique.</p>
<p>For example, one of your products is a reusable, stainless steel water bottle. You could talk about the features and benefits in this way:</p>
<p>Eventually, writing about your products (in alignment with your brand messaging) will become second nature. Your audience will become familiar with it as well.</p>
<p>Consider documenting these details in a brand guidebook, as this will help your team write copy that’s always on point, always accurate, and always on brand.</p>
<p>Once you nail down what makes your brand different from your competitors, make sure you incorporate this into your sales copy.</p>
<p>The “difference” you highlight should always be consistent. Don’t jump around trying different value statements for size; this will only confuse your audience and muddy your message.</p>
<p>For example, if the standout feature of your digital marketing agency is that every client receives a clear, multi-step action plan to implement your recommendations, make that the focal point of your messaging.</p>
<p>Every other agency is going to call their services “data-driven,” “comprehensive,” “effective,” etc.</p>
<p>Do something different by highlighting what truly matters to your audience: the actionable roadmap they’ll come away with after working with you.</p>
<p>Here’s how this might show up in your sales copy:</p>
<p>No matter the platform, use copy to reinforce what makes your brand different (with consistency). Every piece of copy is an opportunity to showcase this differentiation and emphasize why you’re the best choice.</p>
<p>The focus of your ad might change (e.g., a story, client testimonial, video, etc.), but the message should be the same.</p>
<p>How you talk about your products/services, the value you bring to the market, and why that matters to your audience should remain consistent. The experience should feel familiar and very “you.” This helps establish a strong, cohesive identity that your audience can depend on.</p>
<p>It might help to think about it this way: If you know your audience is struggling with X, and the value you offer is Y, what is the Z (solution) that helps them solve their problem?</p>
<p>Using the previous example of moisturizing skincare, here’s how this might look in your sales copy:</p>
<p>Even though the format is different, the core brand message stays the same: We offer a restorative moisturizer that’s hydrating, affordable, and suited for sensitive skin.</p>
<p>One thing we haven’t really talked about here is the messaging behind your call to action (CTA).</p>
<p>These refer to the terms you use to compel users to make a purchase, subscribe to a list, like a post, follow your channel, etc.</p>
<p>Each brand has its preferred CTAs and behaviors it wants prospective customers to take.</p>
<p>CTAs can tie in closely to your brand messaging as well. A compelling CTA reinforces your core message and ensures that every interaction with your audience leads to meaningful engagement.</p>
<p>Instead of generic phrases like “Click Here” or “Learn More,” your CTAs should reflect your brand’s voice and typical path to purchase.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Not only are these CTAs more interesting than the generic alternatives, but they also connect to the unique desires of each respective audience.</p>
<p>Followers of the marketing consultant want an action plan, and they’re told the next step to take in order to get it.</p>
<p>Followers of the skincare brand want hydrating products, so they’re told where to go to buy a moisturizer – clear, consistent, on-brand, and compelling.</p>
<p>CTAs offer a creative place to use messaging to drive action. The better you connect your CTAs to what makes the most sense for your audience, the more likely you will see your conversion rates soar.</p>
<p>When it comes to sales copy, alignment with your brand messaging and audience interests makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Before you can start applying brand messaging to sales copy, you need to understand what your brand represents and how it differs from the competition.</p>
<p>Trust me, evoking a familiar feeling with your audience and showing up online with consistency will help foster more brand visibility, trust, and ultimately, high-yield results.</p>
