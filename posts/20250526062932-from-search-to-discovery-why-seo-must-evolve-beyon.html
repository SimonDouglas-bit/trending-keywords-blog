<p>Search behavior is shifting fast. Here's what it means to win visibility in the age of AI Overviews and assistant engines.</p>
<p>The search landscape undergoes its biggest shift in a generation.</p>
<p>If you’ve been in SEO long enough to remember the glory days of the all-organic search engine results pages (SERP), you’ll know how much of this real estate has been gradually taken over by paid ads, other first-party products, and rich snippets.</p>
<p>Now, the most aggressive transition of all: AI Overviews (as well as search-based large language model platforms).</p>
<p>At BrightonSEO last month, I explored how this evolution is forcing us to rethink what SEO means and why discoverability, not just ranking, is the new north star.</p>
<p>We’ve been reading about the rise of zero-click searches for some time now, but this “takeover” has been much more noticeable over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>I recently searched [how to teach my child to tell the time], and after scrolling through a parade of paid product ads, Google-owned assets, and the AI Overview summaries, I scrolled a good three pages down the SERP.</p>
<p>Google and other search and discovery platforms want to keep users in their ecosystems. For SEO pros, this means traditional metrics such as click-through rate (CTR) are becoming less valuable by the day.</p>
<p>LLMs have changed not just the way a result is displayed to the user but also changed the traditional search flow born within the browser into a multi-step flow that the native SERP simply cannot support in the same way.</p>
<p>The research process is collapsing into a single, seamless exchange.</p>
<p>But as technology accelerates, our own curiosity and research skills are at risk of declining or disappearing completely as the evolution of technology exponentially grows.</p>
<p>Assistant engines and wider LLMs  are the new gatekeepers between our content and the person discovering that content – our potential “new audience.”</p>
<p>They parse, consume, understand, and then synthesize content, which is the deciding factor in what it mentions to whom/what it interacts with.</p>
<p>Structured data is still crucial, as context, transparency, and sentiment matter more than ever.</p>
<p>As an SEO, our challenges with this new behavior affect the way we do – and report on – our jobs.</p>
<p>In reality, many are just old headaches in shiny new wrappers:</p>
<p>The days of our current success metrics are dwindling. The days of vanity-led metrics are coming to an end.</p>
<p>Similar to how our challenges are the same but different, this also applies to how we redefine success metrics:</p>
<p>Information can be aggregated, but personality can’t. This is why it’s still our responsibility to help “assist the assistant” to consider and include you as part of that aggregated information and synthesized answer.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on emerging standards proposals, such as llms.txt, which is one way some are adapting and contributing to how LLMs ingest our content beyond our traditional approaches offered with robots.txt and XML sitemaps.</p>
<p>While some are skeptical about this standard, I believe it is still something worth implementing now, and I understand its true benefits for the future.</p>
<p>There is (virtually) non-existent risk in implementing something that doesn’t take too much time or resources to produce, so long as you’re doing so with a white hat approach.</p>
<p>SEO isn’t dead. It’s expanding, but at a rate we haven’t experienced before.</p>
<p>Discoverability is the new go-to success metric, but it’s not without flaws, especially as the way we search continues to change.</p>
<p>This is no longer about “ranking well” anymore. This is now about being understood, surfaced, trusted, and discovered across every platform and assistant that matters.</p>
<p>Embrace and adapt to the changes, as it’s going to continue for some time.</p>
