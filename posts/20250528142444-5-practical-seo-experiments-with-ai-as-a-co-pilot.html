<p>Published on May 27, 2025</p>

<p>User intent is evolving, and so are our habits around technology.</p>
<p>With the rise of AI, the ways people search and find information are diversifying fast. </p>
<p>Naturally, the way we think about SEO is shifting, too.</p>
<p>But this isn’t a pitch for AI. </p>
Instead, I want to explore how we can treat AI as a collaborator, not a replacement for human expertise, to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">make</a> our workflows more efficient and adaptive in this increasingly complex landscape.
I <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">see</a> AI as a telescope, not the North Star. It helps us see farther and move faster, but we still need to navigate the path ourselves.
With that mindset, I’ll walk you through a series of practical, low-barrier SEO <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a>s where generative AI acts as a co-pilot. 
<p>No armies, no endless budgets, no risky tests – just focused, useful ways to get results.</p>
<p>SEO has always involved waiting for even basic actions. </p>
Publish <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a>, wait. 
<p>Implement internal links, wait. </p>
<p>Fix the page load issue, wait. </p>
<p>Manually test a theory, and sometimes spend weeks watching results unfold.</p>
<p>What changes when you add AI? </p>
You should still wait to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">see</a> the performance. 
But there is a little difference: Now you can ask the right questions and frame the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a> to predict the outcome and make the right decision to get results. 
<p>AI can give you some speed and scale.</p>
<p>It sounds faster, proactive, and more granular to me. If that sounds good to you too, let’s go!</p>
<p>Time and budgets are limited. </p>
<p>That’s why validating ideas that aim to improve user experience (UX) and SEO performance before sharing them with stakeholders or the development team is a very wise action. </p>
<p>After all, no one wants to waste time on a change that may not yield the expected results.</p>
<p>To ensure we don’t overburden our devs, I decided to run an A/B test-like process with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which has:</p>
<p>I wanted to compare the current navigation bar with the version I believed would perform better. </p>
<p>This would help us determine which version would lead to better user engagement and conversion rates, all without prematurely involving the dev team.</p>
I began by feeding Claude information about the current and proposed navigation bar designs, along with data on the website, products, and our web <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a>. 
<p>It assessed both versions and then outlined their strengths, weaknesses, and potential impact on user engagement and conversions.</p>
Disclosure: I work at Designmodo, the SaaS company referenced in this <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a>.
<p>Claude also gave some recommendations to improve the design even more, which helped me refine the idea before bringing it to the team. </p>
<p>After implementing the new version of the navigation bar, we saw a significant increase in user engagement and conversion rates, confirming that the decision to invest time in the changes was the right one. </p>
<p>I’m sure we all have websites we’re confident in. They:</p>
<p>But after a while, for some reason, they stop performing so well. </p>
Maybe user intent has shifted, competitors published better-formatted <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> like lists, tables, and comparisons, or an algorithm update caused it.
In situations like this, we usually audit the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> and the SERP and revise the content based on its current ranking. 
For this <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a>, I decided to let AI assist me in that process.
<p>I used Gemini’s Deep Research to:</p>
I filtered what made sense, shared it with the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> team.
This is a practical example of using AI in this type of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a>.
<p>We made the article more skimmable by:</p>
<p>Within two weeks, impressions jumped. </p>
And after two months, we noticed a piece in the AI Overviews summary from our revised <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a>.
<p>Could I have done this analysis manually? </p>
<p>Sure, I’ve been doing it for years. </p>
But this <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a> allowed me to see how AI can support fast, focused reverse-engineering. And it worked.
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
Understanding how fast different platforms index or surface <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> can help prioritize which pages need attention first. 
To explore this, I ran an experiment to compare how quickly and selectively traditional search engines and generative AI platforms discover new <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a>.
<p>I published 10 different types of pages on one of my test websites, all going live at 4 p.m. on a Saturday.</p>
I didn’t submit these pages for indexing on Google or Bing. Instead, I waited to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">see</a> which platforms would find them organically. 
<p>Meanwhile, I shared the pages on several social media platforms.</p>
<p>Google Search Console’s URL Inspection tool said 8 of the pages were indexed six hours later. </p>
But when I checked with the site: operator, I could only <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">see</a> five of them. 
<p>By the next day, though, all 10 were indexed and visible in Google Search.</p>
Below you can <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">see</a> all the results: 
For the second part of the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a>, I brought AI into the scene.
<p>I asked ChatGPT (using the Reason function) to help analyze the crawl and indexing results and shared the data I had and prompted it accordingly.</p>
<p>The result was impressive: a faster understanding of the correlation between structure, page type, and visibility across engines and generative AI platforms. </p>
<p>And then I benefited from those outputs to prioritize fixing slow-indexing or appearing pages. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that indexing and visibility speed can vary widely depending on factors like a website’s authority, age, internal and external link profile, etc. </p>
So, the results of this kind of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a> will naturally differ for each website.
<p>Sometimes a page that should perform well doesn’t – simply because it isn’t crawlable and therefore can’t be discovered. </p>
<p>Reviewing log files is one of the best ways to diagnose this issue.</p>
But instead of combing through thousands of lines manually, I decided to run an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a> and use ChatGPT’s Advanced Data Analysis function as my co-pilot. 
<p>It scanned for patterns and summarized issues like: </p>
<p>In the end, I had a prioritized list of crawl-related issues. </p>
Rather than spending hours diagnosing problems manually, I was able to use that time to fix them. That’s exactly what a co-pilot should do – <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">make</a> the process easier, not take it over.
We know that publishing fresh <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> regularly helps maintain visibility. 
But have you ever wondered whether the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> velocity of your competitors could be affecting your performance as well?
I wanted to conduct an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a> on this and decided to get a hand from Gemini so as not to disrupt my other priority tasks. 
<p>I asked Gemini to scrape and summarize the blog publish dates from three main competitors. </p>
It gathered all the info I wanted and calculated how often new <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> was being published around key topics. 
<p>Then, I fed it the publishing history of the blog I was focused on.</p>
Gemini gave me a quantified <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">content</a> velocity benchmark, showing how much faster (or slower) others were moving. 
<p>Then I compared it with our publishing frequency to keep up and work on reallocating resources to close the gap. </p>
These small but valuable <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a>s have shown me that AI-based platforms still depend heavily on human expertise to operate and interpret their outputs, make informed decisions, and guide their responsible use. 
<p>We, not AI, should remain the true North Stars of our roadmaps, with AI serving as a helpful assistant.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s essential never to rely on AI blindly. </p>
<p>Always question its output, especially in an environment where mistakes can cost significant revenue. </p>
Use AI thoughtfully and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115021-deepseek-r1-671b-q4km-with-1-or-2-arc-a770-on-xeon.html">experiment</a>ally – not as a shortcut, but as a powerful tool to enhance execution and achieve better results.
