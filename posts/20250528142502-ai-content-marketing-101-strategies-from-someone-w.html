<p>This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic.</p>
According to our upcoming study, 87% of marketers use AI for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>. I’m one of them.
AI helped me build a career around writing. It’s part of nearly everything I do. Honestly, I can’t <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">even</a> remember how I worked without it—and I don’t want to.
It gives me a “second brain” and superhuman speed, and takes care of all the tedious tasks I dis<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> about my job.
<p>Sure, maybe one day AI will replace my job. But right now? The real risk is not using it and falling behind everyone who is.</p>
This guide shares everything I’ve learned from about two years of using AI in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> marketing, often before my managers believed in it. I’ll show you when to lean into your human strengths and when to let AI take over.
AI is cheaper. About 4.7x cheaper than human-made <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>.
If you look at the distribution of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> cost, you’ll see more AI users towards the left with the lower cost. Marketers who don’t use AI always pay more.
<p>And AI makes everything cheaper, from blog posts to videos and whitepapers.</p>
<p>But is it actually any good, or are people just trying to cut down costs?</p>
<p>I’m going to give you first-hand examples of where AI is absolutely phenomenal, almost necessary. No theory, just tried and tested stuff I can’t imagine working without.</p>
AI can help you get past the blank page by suggesting topics, story angles, keywords for SEO, and headline variations. It’s a quick way to explore options and keep your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> calendar full without scrambling for inspiration.
For example, in my guides, I always suggest starting keyword research by letting AI come up with the first ideas (aka seed keywords). Don’t worry if you’re not sure what those are—AI knows, and it’s surprisingly good at finding them. You can ask any large language model (LLM) to help, or just <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> the AI inside Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer to instantly generate thousands of keyword ideas from those starting points.
Got a topic in mind? AI can help you see how strong it really is. Whether it’s over<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>d, has untapped angles, or is missing something important.
<p>The goal isn’t just to have AI come up with something better but to help you see angles you might not have thought of. In the end, you’ll end up with a more refined idea and save time for both you and your editors by cutting down on all the back-and-forth.</p>
<p>Gael Breton of Authority Hackers recently demonstrated his version of that on the Ahrefs Podcast.</p>
Try it yourself. Past this prompt in ChatGPT (works in the free version) or better yet, a ChatGPT bot creator, and share some <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> ideas with it.
<p>Instead of digging through dozens of tabs, AI can summarize articles, pull key points, and spot patterns. That means less time gathering info and more time actually using it.</p>
I regularly crowdsource input for my articles. Sometimes, I <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> Help a B2B Reporter Out, and other times, I just post a request on LinkedIn. Within a few days, I usually get dozens of quotes from real people. And when it’s too much to sort through on my own… yep, I turn to AI. But not just any LLM. Most have context windows that are too small for this kind of task.
<p>And I couldn’t recommend deep research features enough. You can find them in ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, and probably a few others.</p>
Deep research in LLMs means improving AI tools’ ability to find accurate, trustworthy, and detailed information. Instead of guessing based on what it learned during training, an LLM can now look up real-time facts from articles, websites, or documents. It can break down complex questions, search in steps, and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> tools to double-check its answers.
For example, I <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>d deep research on the data study that examined the correlation between the organic traffic of publicly traded companies on Nasdaq and their stock value.
<p>I needed to check whether someone else had done similar research before me and what they had found. Gemini did that for me while I was having lunch.</p>
<p>And by the way, pretty much all of the number crunching in that article and a bunch of other data studies I did was all AI. I mean:</p>
<p>That said, the data study part of the article became much deeper and more interesting when I invited an actual data scientist to do their magic. AI doesn’t win every race yet, but more on that in a bit.</p>
If you write with SEO in mind, like I do, using AI to outline or even draft your articles just makes sense. Google looks for consensus, and LLMs mirror it. Since they’re trained on the collective <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> of the web, they “naturally” pick up on the patterns and structures that tend to rank well.
Let’s take search intent for example. I remember when I had to find it manually to make sure my articles would match what the searchers expect. I’d open each of the top-ranking pages to see what it’s about and what subtopics I’d need to include in my article. Now Ahrefs’ AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> Helper does that for me. And if the intent is mixed, it lets me choose what I want to tackle.
<p>Then, the tool maps out exactly which topics and subtopics I need to cover in any new article—or shows what’s missing in an existing article—by analyzing what’s actually ranking in the top 10.</p>
Use projects in ChatGPT and Claude for each topic you’re making <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> about.
Projects are <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> dedicated workspaces for each topic you’re working on. Instead of starting from scratch every time, the AI remembers everything you’ve done—your ideas, drafts, tone, and goals. Plus, you can store reference files.
Working in projects allows me to simply say something <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> this:
<p>“Read the files I just added and let me know if there’s anything interesting I could add to the article.” Or, “I’m stuck on the first example in the draft.”</p>
<p>That’s it, I don’t need to upload files each time and explain what I mean by “example” or “draft”.</p>
If you’re on a small <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> team, my guess is someone on that team handles technical SEO. And my other guess is that they don’t like it. Who would enjoy fixing dozens of meta descriptions and title issues, or asking their busy dev team to fix these?
SEO tools were quick to adopt AI to solve problems <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> this. So now, when Ahrefs flags a bunch of my articles for having too-long titles, I can fix them in no time. I just use AI to rewrite them all in one go and push the updates straight to the site, right from within Side Audit.
AI tools can flag things like clunky sentences, broken grammar, awkward phrasing, and off-brand tone. It’s a useful way to clean things up and help your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> perform better without rewriting everything.
For example, I made a bot for myself that’s trained on my past <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> to make everything sound like the publish-ready me.
<p>I have another bot that generates WordPress shortcodes and meta descriptions so I don’t have to. All I need to do is upload the article.</p>
<p>What’s cool about it is that AI creates a nice, SEO-friendly URL slug for each subsection of the article.</p>
AI can help you make sense of performance data, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> which posts are getting read, shared, or ignored. Instead of staring at dashboards, you get clear takeaways to shape your next steps.
<p>These days, whenever I write about analyzing data, it always boils down to the same advice: export your data, take screenshots if needed, and hand everything over to the smartest AI tool you can find.</p>
For example, you can use a bot like the one I built for the marketing analytics guide to run the numbers on your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> marketing data. It’ll give you a full analysis and even some solid recommendations.
Another example. My editor, Ryan Law, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>d AI to write code from a description in natural language (aka vibe coding) for a Google Search Console reporting tool. He just describes what he wants, and the AI codes it.
<p>And here’s the tool running, ready to create the report he needs:</p>
<p>AI makes it easier to repurpose a blog post into an X thread, LinkedIn post, newsletter blurb, or video script. It can also help with scheduling and finding the best times to publish across platforms.</p>
<p>Notice I said, “It makes it easier,” but not that it does everything for you. I’m bullish on this tech, but I still wouldn’t trust it to post directly to my social channels on its own. That said, as a social media sidekick that never runs out of ideas or energy, it’s incredibly helpful.</p>
Here’s an example of this: a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> repurposing workflow designed in Zapier by Ryan. It waits for a new article on our blog, creates three types of LinkedIn posts and uploads them to Buffer for review.
<p>And here’s a sample outcome.</p>
Even before AI became a buzzword, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> automation was already helping us escape the dull, repetitive parts of content management. But now, with AI agents, we’re moving far beyond just automating simple tasks. These tools are capable of handling even complex, creative work.
Imagine this: an AI agent notices when a new blog post goes live in your CMS. It then takes care of everything that follows: compressing images, generating metadata, scheduling social media teasers, updating your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> calendar, and even logging each action for transparency. All of this happens automatically.
I was recently trying AirOps with some surprisingly good outcomes. The secret is that under the hood, it handles everything from topic research and search intent analysis to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> creation, originality checks, and more through an AI automation workflow. Every part of it is customizable.
Now, AI agents are getting <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">even</a> smarter thanks to something called MCPs, short for Model Context Protocols. Think of MCPs as bridges that let AI talk to other apps more easily, without the need to write custom API code every time. They even allow one AI to communicate with another.
Here’s a quick example: I recently <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>d Claude together with our new Ahrefs MCP. With just a prompt, it helped me discover fresh keyword opportunities for our blog and even brainstormed a few title ideas for each one.
<p>It’s a fairly simple MCP AI agent, but I bet listing what it did there already makes you want to automate that stuff. It had to:</p>
<p>And I don’t just mean “translate” in a way that it’s comprehensible to someone who speaks another language, I mean make it culturally appropriate and well-received, including social and linguistic nuances.</p>
<p>Our Head of International Marketing, Erik Sarissky, says the tech is not perfect yet, but it gets you at least half of the way in no time and makes human proofreading so much easier.</p>
Now that ChatGPT can remember good responses, it can re<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> accurate translations the next time it handles a similar localization task. Erik’s team uses that to build their own custom dictionary as they go.
This is one of my favorite <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> cases and an example of how AI enhances your intelligence. OR, more accurately, brings you to results you would probably get anyway, but you’re there way quicker.
<p>For example, a few moments ago, I got stuck trying to make my point sound good.</p>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
You could write an entire opinion piece this way. You give AI the arc of the story or just a braindump of what you know or would <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> to say about the topic(the fun part), and it makes up the words in between (the boring part).
Below is a quick snapshot of today’s AI toolkit for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> teams. I’ve grouped the most useful apps into seven practical buckets, from writing assistants and SEO boosters to a new wave of “AI chat aggregators” like TypingMind and Poe that put multiple large-language models under one roof.
Scan the table to see what each category does and which tools are leading the charge; <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> it as a reference when deciding where to invest your time, budget, or next experiment.
Only about 14% of the people we polled said that AI-only <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> was better.
I agree with the majority. Because there’s the deal: AI is great at making good enough <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>, but only humans can create great content.
<p>That’s not all—we’re better at strategic thinking, too.</p>
<p>We humans have something AI doesn’t—imagination, intuition, foresight, empathy. We don’t just analyze things, we actually experience them. That gives us a deeper understanding of what really matters and makes us better judges of what’s publish-ready.</p>
<p>Here’s my take on why a superhuman intelligence always requires human oversight. Or, why going 100% AI is always a bad idea.</p>
We pick up on sarcasm, cultural cues, and tone in ways AI often misses. AI-generated <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> can feel weird, even if it’s technically correct. We read it and think, “Who talks like that?
<p>We’re much better at judging what actually matters, and that changes depending on the person, context, or moment. We don’t just understand meaning; we “feel” it through life experiences. That’s why humans usually write better summaries.</p>
Experience gives weight to words, helping us decide what’s worth saying. AI, on the other hand, strings together what’s statistically <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a>ly. But we’re not looking for likely, we’re looking for right.
<p>ChatGPT excels at crunching numbers but often fails to turn insights into strategy. I found two studies that explain why.</p>
One showed that expert human “superforecasters” outperformed AI-human hybrid systems by 20%; they were simply better at spotting what really matters. The other found that people paired with AI assistants (<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">even</a> biased ones) forecasted more accurately than those working alone.
<p>The takeaway? AI can sharpen our thinking, but it’s still the human brain that sees what’s coming around the bend.</p>
Real emotion comes from lived experience; we sense what an audience feels and respond with genuine warmth, something <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">even</a> the best “sentiment model” can only mimic superficially.
<p>The crazy thing? AI is fully aware of that.</p>
When you ask what it’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> to be AI, the answer is surprisingly accurate and brutally honest—it’s all a simulation.
Great <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> doesn’t just make people think. It makes them feel. We’re far better at this than any machine.
<p>Based on our data, the top reason people gave for not using AI was that they don’t trust its accuracy—60% said that was their main concern. That lines up with pretty much every other study on AI I’ve seen.</p>
Even though AI tools are fast and helpful, many people worry they might get things wrong, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> making up facts or misreading data.
This is a big deal in areas <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> finance or health, where one small mistake can hurt your reputation or get you in legal trouble.
<p>AI doesn’t really understand what it’s writing; it just pulls patterns from what it’s seen before. So it might sound smart, but still be wrong. That’s why most people feel it’s important to double-check anything AI creates, especially if it’s going to be published or shared.</p>
<p>The key difference is that we humans usually know when we’re making something up or stretching the truth. We know what we don’t know and as weird as this may sound, this inconspicuous trait gives us edge over AI.</p>
<p>For instance, here’s what ChatGPT told me when I asked for the definition of vibe marketing. That term hasn’t been included in the AI’s training data yet. Of course, it’s wrong, but look how there’s not a tiny bit of doubt or some kind of system flag.</p>
Ethics is your insurance policy against lawsuits, takedowns, and brand-trust erosion. Here are the three ethical hotspots for us <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> marketers.
Tech site CNET quietly rolled out 77 AI-written finance articles; over half needed factual corrections and some copied competitors’ text. When readers discovered that the byline “CNET Money Staff” masked a bot, trust cratered and the publisher hit the brakes on AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> publishing this statement:
Safeguard: consider adding a short “AI-assisted” note to every piece. For visuals, you can watermark synthetic images so you’re ready for regulations <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> the EU AI Act.
<p>Getty Images v. Stability AI shows the risk of training on material you don’t own. Getty claims Stable Diffusion scraped 12 million watermarked photos without a license, and UK judges are letting the core infringement claims proceed.</p>
<p>AI may remix at warp speed, but if the training data or output lifts protected words or images, takedowns and lawsuits land on you, not the bot.</p>
<p>Safeguard: run a plagiarism scan before you hit publish. Try out our free tool here.</p>
<p>And never ever feed personal or sensitive data into large language models.</p>
<p>AI learns from the internet, and the internet isn’t neutral.</p>
Safeguard: If you operate in very sensitive topics, you can check your prompts with tools <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> Bias-Free AI Prompt Checker. You can develop your own bot that checks answers for any bias and improve it as you go. You can start with something like:
AI is only as useful as how you use it. To really make it work in your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> workflow, you need a clear approach. Here’s how to integrate AI without adding noise, sacrificing quality, or losing control.
Not all AI tools are the same or <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">even</a> made with your goals in mind. So don’t get swept up in the hype. Take the time to do your homework and focus on tools that actually help you get work done.
While researching AI tools for SEO recently, I was shocked by how many of them overpromise. Some even claim they can run your entire SEO strategy on autopilot. Really? Ask any seasoned SEO professional if they’d hand over their whole strategy to a tool <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> that. Spoiler: they won’t.
Also, I think that this is the lesson that Klarna recently learned the hard way. They replaced support staff with AI beca<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>… there was an AI for that. Customers hated it, so now Klarna has to rehire people who were doing a great job in the first place.
People on your team will <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> AI, with or without guidance. Better to be proactive.
Spell out what’s fair game for automation and what still needs a human touch. Define clear <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> cases, draw the line where quality matters, and make sure everyone’s on the same page.
For example, my editor is completely okay with letting simple data studies like this one be nearly 100% AI (with a human double-checking sensitive places, of course). You can check yours using our free AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> Detector.
<p>Let AI handle the repetitive stuff: summarizing research, cleaning up grammar, formatting, first drafts, but keep people in charge of the big-picture thinking.</p>
The more mental space your team has for creative, strategic work, the better your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> will be.
<p>AI can make you smarter, but it can’t be left alone. ALWAYS review before you publish. Double-review when the stakes are high.</p>
Most teams already do this: 97% of marketers review AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> before it goes live. Manual checks are the most common (80%), followed by input from subject matter experts (35%) and editors (30%).
In industries <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> finance or healthcare, skipping this can be brand-breaking. As one expert I interviewed for a guide on finance SEO put it:
“AI-generated <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> is one of the fastest ways to drive a financial brand off a cliff.”
The fix? Run high-stakes <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> through an extra layer of human review. Think compliance checks, expert validation, and final edits by someone who understands the audience, the stakes, and the strategy.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> marketing today feels a lot like the auto industry just before robots hit the assembly line. Back then, most car manufacturers turned to robotics to boost efficiency and cut down on errors.
That’s the same crossroads we’re at in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> marketing. You can go the “Rolls-Royce” route, meticulously hand-crafting each piece of content, banking on exceptional quality and a reputation you’ll need years to build. Or you can take the “Toyota” path—blend human creativity with AI to work smarter, faster, and with fewer mistakes.
Neither path is easy. Handcrafted <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> needs to be undeniably superior to justify the time and cost. AI-powered content, on the other hand, levels the playing field. Everyone gets a productivity boost.
The real edge, then, comes from how you <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> the time and headspace AI frees up—to better understand your audience, to be more creative, and to bring something truly human to the table.
And just like car buyers don’t care how many robots built their vehicle as long as it drives well, very few people will care how your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> was made.
I’d <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> to leave you with one last thought.
Anyone can hit “generate.” However, the difference between average and truly strategic AI-powered <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> comes down to the marketer behind the tool.
Think about it: if you were hiring an AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> Architect, wouldn’t you want someone with real marketing experience? Without it, how could they tell good work from bad?
<p>Lean into your human strengths and learn to let AI handle the rest. That’s how you make yourself harder to replace by AI.</p>
