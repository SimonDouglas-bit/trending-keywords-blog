<p>International SEO takes more than translations and tags. Here’s what effective teams actually focus on when expanding search reach.</p>

<p>How does AI change the translation game?</p>
<p>We have to acknowledge that AI revolutionizes international expansion.</p>
<p>It can localize content and creative at scale, with low cost and high fidelity.</p>
<p>For example, AI tools can identify local synonyms, slang, or spelling variations that match native search queries. Companies can create custom translation models tailored to their existing content, brand, voice, and tone.</p>
<p>A great example is Reddit, which has been using AI to translate content into other countries.</p>
<p>From Reddit Masterclass:</p>
<p>We can actually translate the existing Reddit corpus into other languages at human quality. Now, not all the content is relevant, but a lot of it is. We have been testing this in France, in French, in the first half of this year, and it’s gone very, very well.</p>
<p>It’s going well, indeed. As you can see in the screenshot below, Reddit is growing rapidly in many markets around the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of localization is to create more “starter content” that inspires users in other countries to sign up and post on Reddit, which, in return, creates content that inspires more users to do the same.</p>
<p>Appearing in international search results is important to get that flywheel going.</p>
<p>The Reddit example shows that AI has become good enough for large-scale localization.</p>
<p>Another example is Airbnb, which has been using AI/ML to translate listing descriptions and reviews in over 60 languages:</p>
<p>As cross border travel returns, Airbnb’s new Translation Engine will provide a seamless experience for our Hosts and guests in over 60 languages. Translation Engine removes the need for click to translate buttons by automatically translating listing descriptions and reviews. Based on results from a study across our top ten languages we commissioned by a top machine translation evaluation company, Translation Engine improves the quality of more than 99% of Airbnb listings. Translation Engine uses millions of Airbnb data points to improve translations, so it will get even smarter over time as it learns from new content that’s submitted.1</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are starting or growing your international SEO program, you should consider using these tools, especially if you want to avoid the most missed traps of internationalization that many marketing teams overlook.</p>
<p>And yet, I want to caution against not leaving humans out of the loop. Mistakes can, and will, happen. So, add a human QA step to the end of the localization pipeline.</p>
<p>Many teams stumble on the same two hidden traps when it comes to international SEO:</p>
<p>Below, I’ll show you how to dodge these pitfalls for smoother, smarter global growth.</p>
<p>Expanding global web presence often results in too many duplicated or minimally localized country-specific websites.</p>
<p>Split domain authority, duplicate content issues, confused search engines, and diluted user engagement. Not good.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is creating multiple localized site versions that are language-identical or very similar (e.g., separate sites for U.S. English, U.K. English, AU English, CA English, IN English, and so on).</p>
<p>While the intention makes practical sense, the end result often spells disaster for SEO. Multiple English-language URLs containing almost identical content quickly trigger potential duplicate-content issues.</p>
<p>IBM moved from 180 ccTLDs to 38 folders and saw a significant traffic uplift in organic traffic and a reduction in crawl errors.</p>
<p>From the IBM deep dive:</p>
<p>Moving country subdirectories to language subdirectories shrank the site from 165 local sites to 10 language-specific sites. This change was both an improvement for international SEO and a pruning campaign.</p>
<p>A counter-example is this domain, which has too many country subdirectories.</p>
<p>For example, it has a subdirectory for /en and /en-us/. As you can see from the diverging traffic lines in the screenshot below, Google struggles to understand which subdirectory to rank at the top.</p>
<p>When evaluating local conditions through the lens of proper, functional localization across your site, focus your attention on these key dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regulatory, legal, and compliance conditions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain markets present unique regulatory obligations where you’ll have to take specific actions. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technical infrastructure and user context.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tech constraints and habits shape recreation choices, speed expectations, and UX localization needs, like:</p>
<p>Many brands mistakenly treat localizing content as simply translating text into foreign languages (“word-for-word”).</p>
<p>But translation only handles basic information, ignoring deeper nuances around culture, emotion, humor, symbolism, taboos, and context.</p>
<p>There are several different methods/approaches to localization:</p>
<p>But most brands only focus on word-for-word translation or light localization of content. Many orgs miss out on investing in deeper localization, culturalization, or co-creation.</p>
<p>If you focus only on word-for-word translation or light localization efforts, rather than doing the deeper work of cultivation of content and even co-creation, it can cause huge breaks in trust and/or missed conversion opportunities.</p>
<p>These real-world missteps show costly localization shortcuts in action:</p>
<p>When evaluating local conditions through the lens of deep localization, focus your attention on these key dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alphabetical and linguistic differences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pay attention to the localization work needed for non-Latin alphabets and scripts. Examples include:</p>
<p>Plus, your team should acknowledge and consider multilingual complexities.</p>
<p>India is an excellent example of this, with 22 official languages, and search behaviors in Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali significantly differ from English.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alternative search engine landscapes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not every market is dominated by Google. Adapt SEO strategies for local search engine market share.</p>
<p>Here are a few instances to keep in mind where Google isn’t the primary search engine:</p>
<p>Applying thorough localization steps will avoid costly mistakes, preserve positive brand perception, and unlock organic reach in new markets effectively.</p>
<p>Our biggest SEO win at Shopify – ever – was domain unification.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2022, we combined all ccTLDs and language subdomains under the .com root directory and saw a +2x uplift in organic traffic.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, growth was incremental and not just due to adding more content to the domain.</p>
<p>International expansion can really be the growth lever you’re looking for, as long as you keep the following guidelines:</p>
<p>If you know me, you know I’m a big proponent of subdirectories.</p>
<p>I mean, you can’t blame me after the success I’ve seen with it at Shopify.</p>
<p>So, to be crystal clear, there are advantages to each:</p>
<p>From a purely SEO POV, I suggest you go with a subdirectory for languages.</p>
<p>A common question I get is whether to translate URL slugs.</p>
<p>There are strong pros and cons, which I will go into below.</p>
<p>But my recommendation is to keep the slug for markets that share the Latin alphabet and translate slugs for different alphabets (e.g., Japanese, Arabic).</p>
<p>Pros to translating URL slugs:</p>
<p>Cons to translating URL slugs:</p>
<p>To account for the technical side of things, you must keep the following in mind:</p>
<p>I will say, even with perfect technical optimization and localization, Google sometimes struggles to show the right URLs or even the domain in the right country.</p>
<p>I discuss some of the things you can do with Daan Aussems on LinkedIn:</p>
<p>When setting up your international SEO function, you’ll need to decide between two main structural approaches:</p>
<p>Choosing the right one depends on your organization’s resources, local market requirements, and the depth of localization you’ll pursue.</p>
<p>In a centralized structure, one SEO team (typically in your home or core market) manages SEO across all international markets.</p>
<p>When to pick this option: </p>
<p>Ideal if you’re early in the internationalization phase with limited internal resources or for situations where nuances between different regions aren’t highly sensitive.</p>
<p>In this hybrid approach, you have one central strategy-setting team supported by local SEO specialists who are native to each target market.</p>
<p>A good middle ground might be a core (central) SEO team plus native speaker specialists dedicated to your highest-potential or highest-complexity markets.</p>
<p>When to pick this option: </p>
<p>Perfectly suited for large sites with complicated localized strategies, high cultural sensitivity, significant growth goals in international markets, and sufficient internal resourcing.</p>
<p>Regardless of which team structure you choose, clarity around reporting lines is essential. A clear organizational structure for most successful global companies often includes:</p>
<p>This arrangement separates content production (managed by branding/content teams) and the optimization of that content (managed by SEO teams).</p>
<p>Successful international SEO workflows vary significantly by your business type.</p>
<p>Below are tailored recommendations clearly segmented by ecommerce and SaaS/digital product business models, since that makes up most of my readers here.</p>
<p>But if you’re in another industry and have questions about tailored SEO workflows or recommendations for your business type, drop your question to me via comment or mailbag (part of the premium subscription).</p>
<p>Clearly communicate and optimize for regional purchasing expectations to increase trust and conversions:</p>
<p>For global SaaS/digital products, localized trust emerges not just from content, but also from user experience framing and region-specific nuance:</p>
<p>I get this question a lot: When should I expand into an international SEO play?</p>
<p>Knowing when to move beyond your core domestic market can be just as critical as knowing how.</p>
<p>While growing slowly within your home market may feel safer or easier, you’re potentially leaving significant growth untapped.</p>
<p>At the same time, expanding prematurely into international markets might stretch resources thin and dilute your initial peak-market potential.</p>
<p>So, how should you discern when the time is ripe to expand internationally?</p>
<p>In some scenarios, opting to capture market share overseas before competing in a saturated domestic market can even become a strategic advantage, called counter-positioning.</p>
<p>Companies can rapidly establish strongholds in regions lacking dominant incumbents, leverage brand equity abroad first, and only then turn toward challenging larger opponents in the United States or more mature markets.</p>
<p>An example of this approach is StuDocu, a European-born study content-sharing site, versus the initially U.S.-oriented ed-tech giant Course Hero.</p>
<p>Rather than directly challenging Course Hero head-on within saturated American campuses, StuDocu methodically expanded into underserved European, Asian, Latin American, and Australian universities – regions that Course Hero gave lower priority.</p>
<p>This strategic “root growth” in international territories allowed StuDocu to scale rapidly, create a vast global user base, create defensible moats locally, and eventually build the brand equity necessary to mount an effective push into highly competitive markets, including the United States.</p>
<p>There are a few clear criteria every global growth leader should closely examine to inform their strategic expansion timing:</p>
<p>Before investing heavily, ensure there’s a substantial unmet organic and paid search opportunity around your core offering and targeted keywords.</p>
<p>Examine your analytics and search queries: Do you already get meaningful visits or searches from the target country? Strong brand indicators can accelerate your market entry.</p>
<p>Quantify current organic visits and branded keywords from those markets despite not actively targeting or marketing to them.</p>
<p>For example, if your analytics reveal repeated organic traffic from Germany with users searching explicitly for your company name or key terms, it signals existing awareness, early-adopter userbase, or even offline word-of-mouth that deserves deeper attention.</p>
<p>Evaluate how mature each prospective target market currently is and understand the competitive landscape deeply:</p>
<p>Validate economic logic through a comprehensive market-sizing exercise and initial return-on-investment (ROI) forecasts.</p>
<p>Markets vary broadly by total addressable market (TAM). Scrutinize total market population, GDP per capita, digital connectivity/internet penetration, and mobile saturation data (World Bank, Euromonitor, Statista).</p>
<p>Even leading SEO and financial criteria scores can be blocked or undermined by inefficient operational, legal, or team-related feasibility realities towards a market.</p>
<p>Explicitly identify:</p>
<p>I want to share a few other tools I’ve used over the years.</p>
<p>To evaluate the market as a whole:</p>
<p>To evaluate traffic potential and competitive saturation:</p>
<p>To evaluate purchasing power and market potential:</p>
