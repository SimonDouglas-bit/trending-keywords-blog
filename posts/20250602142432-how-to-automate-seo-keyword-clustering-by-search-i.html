<p>This practical guide uses SERP comparisons and Python to group keywords by intent, faster and more intuitively.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to know about search intent, from using deep learning to infer search intent by classifying text and breaking down SERP titles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, to clustering based on semantic relevance, with the benefits explained.</p>
<p>Not only do we know the benefits of deciphering search intent, but we also have a number of techniques at our disposal for scale and automation.</p>
<p>So, why do we need another article on automating search intent?</p>
<p>Search intent is ever more important now that AI search has arrived.</p>
<p>While more was generally in the 10 blue links search era, the opposite is true with AI search technology, as these platforms generally seek to minimize the computing costs (per FLOP) in order to deliver the service.</p>
<p>The techniques so far involve doing your own AI, that is, getting all of the copy from titles of the ranking content for a given keyword and then feeding it into a neural network model (which you have to then build and test) or using NLP to cluster keywords.</p>
<p>What if you don’t have time or the knowledge to build your own AI or invoke the Open AI API?</p>
<p>While cosine similarity has been touted as the answer to helping SEO professionals navigate the demarcation of topics for taxonomy and site structures, I still maintain that search clustering by SERP results is a far superior method.</p>
<p>That’s because AI is very keen to ground its results on SERPs and for good reason – it’s modelled on user behaviors.</p>
<p>There is another way that uses Google’s very own AI to do the work for you, without having to scrape all the SERPs content and build an AI model.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that Google ranks site URLs by the likelihood of the content satisfying the user query in descending order. It follows that if the intent for two keywords is the same, then the SERPs are likely to be similar.</p>
<p>For years, many SEO professionals compared SERP results for keywords to infer shared (or shared) search intent to stay on top of core updates, so this is nothing new.</p>
<p>The value-add here is the automation and scaling of this comparison, offering both speed and greater precision.</p>
<p>Assuming you have your SERPs results in a CSV download, let’s import it into your Python notebook.</p>
<p>Below is the SERPs file now imported into a Pandas dataframe.</p>
<p>We want to compare the Page 1 results of each SERP between keywords.</p>
<p>We’ll split the dataframe into mini keyword dataframes to run the filtering function before recombining into a single dataframe, because we want to filter at the keyword level:</p>
<p>Because there are more SERP result URLs than keywords, we need to compress those URLs into a single line to represent the keyword’s SERP.</p>
<p>Below shows the SERP compressed into a single line for each keyword.</p>
<p>To perform the comparison, we now need every combination of keyword SERP paired with other pairs:</p>
<p>The above shows all of the keyword SERP pair combinations, making it ready for SERP string comparison.</p>
<p>There is no open-source library that compares list objects by order, so the function has been written for you below.</p>
<p>The function “serp_compare” compares the overlap of sites and the order of those sites between SERPs.</p>
<p>Now that the comparisons have been executed, we can start clustering keywords.</p>
<p>We will be treating any keywords that have a weighted similarity of 40% or more.</p>
<p>We now have the potential topic name, keywords SERP similarity, and search volumes of each.</p>
<p>You’ll note that keyword and keyword_b have been renamed to topic and keyword, respectively.</p>
<p>Now we’re going to iterate over the columns in the dataframe using the lambda technique.</p>
<p>The lambda technique is an efficient way to iterate over rows in a Pandas dataframe because it converts rows to a list as opposed to the .iterrows() function.</p>
<p>Below shows a dictionary containing all the keywords clustered by search intent into numbered groups:</p>
<p>Let’s stick that into a dataframe:</p>
<p>The search intent groups above show a good approximation of the keywords inside them, something that an SEO expert would likely achieve.</p>
<p>Although we only used a small set of keywords, the method can obviously be scaled to thousands (if not more).</p>
<p>Of course, the above could be taken further using neural networks, processing the ranking content for more accurate clusters and cluster group naming, as some of the commercial products out there already do.</p>
<p>For now, with this output, you can:</p>
<p>I’m sure there are more applications that I haven’t mentioned – feel free to comment on any important ones that I’ve not already mentioned.</p>
<p>In any case, your SEO keyword research just got that little bit more scalable, accurate, and quicker!</p>
