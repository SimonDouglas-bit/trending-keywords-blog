<p>New study of 25,000 searches shows that top Google rankings still matter for ChatGPT, Perplexity, and AI search results.</p>
<p>New research analyzing 25,000 user searches found that websites ranked #1 on Google appear in AI search answers 25% of the time.</p>
<p>This data demonstrates that traditional SEO remains relevant, despite claims that AI has rendered it obsolete.</p>
<p>Tomasz Rudzki, co-founder of ZipTie, studied real searches across ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google’s AI Overviews. His findings challenge the widespread belief that AI makes traditional SEO pointless.</p>
<p>The data shows a clear pattern: if you rank #1 on Google, you have a 1-in-4 chance of appearing in AI search results. Lower rankings result in lower chances.</p>
<p>“The higher you rank in Google’s top 10, the more likely you are to appear in AI search results across platforms. This isn’t speculation – it’s based on real queries from real users.”</p>
<p>The pattern holds across all major AI search platforms, suggesting that they all rely on traditional rankings when selecting sources.</p>
<p>The study detailed how AI search operates, using information from Google’s antitrust trial. The process involves three main steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Pre-selection
AI systems identify the best documents for each query, favoring pages with higher Google rankings.</p>
<p>Step 2: Content Extraction
The AI extracts relevant information from these top-ranking pages, prioritizing content that directly answers the user’s question.</p>
<p>Step 3: AI Synthesis
The AI synthesizes this information into one clear answer, utilizing Google’s Gemini model for this step.</p>
<p>Google’s internal documents from the trial confirmed a critical fact: using top-ranking content enhances the accuracy of AI responses, which explains why traditional rankings continue to be so significant.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you’ll come across sources that don’t make it into the top 10. Research identified two reasons why:</p>
<p>Reason 1: Personalization</p>
<p>Search results differ by user. A page might rank high for one user but not for another.</p>
<p>Reason 2: Query Fan-Out</p>
<p>This is the more significant factor. According to Google’s documentation:</p>
<p>“Both AI Overviews and AI Mode may use a ‘query fan-out‘ technique — issuing multiple related searches across subtopics and data sources — to develop a response.”</p>
<p>Here’s what that means in simple terms:</p>
<p>When you search for “SEO vs SEM,” the AI discreetly runs multiple searches:</p>
<p>Pages that perform well for these additional searches can appear in results even if they don’t rank for your primary search.</p>

<p>The research shows we need to think differently about content.</p>
<p>Traditional SEO focused on creating the “best page.” This meant comprehensive guides covering everything about a topic.</p>
<p>AI search wants the “best answer.” This means specific, focused responses to exact questions.</p>
<p>The analysis notes:</p>
<p>“When someone asks specifically about iPhone 15 battery life, you may rank top 1 in Google, but AI doesn’t care about it if you don’t provide a precise, relevant answer to that exact question.”</p>
<p>Marketers need to shift from keyword optimization to answering real questions.</p>

<p>Here’s what marketers should do based on these findings:</p>
<p>This research comes at the perfect time. AI search is growing rapidly. Understanding how it connects to traditional rankings gives you an edge.</p>
<p>Consider this: Only 25% of #1-ranked content appears in AI results. That means 75% is missing out. This suggests an opportunity for marketers who adapt.</p>
<p>Rudzki concludes:</p>
<p>“Instead of asking ‘How do I rank higher?’ start asking ‘How do I better serve users who have specific questions?’ That mindset shift is the key to thriving in the AI search era.”</p>
<p>For an industry experiencing rapid adoption of AI, these findings provide a strong foundation for informed strategic decisions. Instead of abandoning SEO practices, the evidence suggests building on what already works.</p>
