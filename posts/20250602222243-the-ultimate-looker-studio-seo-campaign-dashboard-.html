<p>Published on June 02, 2025</p>
</div>
        Google’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio is a web-based reporting tool that lets SEO professionals and agencies create custom, interactive dashboards to show SEO performance.  
<p>What’s so great about it? </p>
Looker Studio puts SEOs and agencies in full control of how they present <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>, with the freedom to pull from multiple sources. That level of customization isn’t standard in most third-party SEO tools.
<p>Freelancers can easily configure it with a simple Google Sheets. </p>
<p>And agencies, maybe with developers, can provide full end-to-end automation and deployment workflows.</p>
Today, I’ll show you the exact <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio dashboard principles and frameworks we use to generate live SEO dashboards to track real SEO performance.
This ultimate <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> campaign dashboard template is a fresh take on a tried-and-tested design that has roots going back 20 years at my SEO agency.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> reporting is complex. Clients want better insights into SEO performance than what they are getting. 
Looker Studio’s flexibility to ingest <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> from any source allows SEOs and agencies to adapt their reporting to highlight new data points of interest when they need it. 
This is especially relevant today as SEOs want to track new <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> points related to ChatGPT, LLMs, and AI Overviews. 
<p>For example, instead of just reporting on keyword rankings, you could report on any Google SERP feature – whatever matters most to your client. </p>
In other words, it’s not a “fixed” <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> with the same set of metrics. It’s a framework that can evolve with you. 
At my agency, we were able to create a flexible “model” <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> that we can clone for each new client, and then customize it to their needs.
To put <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio’s power into perspective, we were able to replicate the functionality of a leading rank tracking tool – one that arguably took more than a decade to develop – in just a few weeks with Looker Studio.
Now, it’s worth noting that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio has a steep learning curve, but that’s the trade-off with a tool this flexible. 
However, for those with programming experience, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio becomes even more powerful and easier to use. 
If <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio seems daunting, start small! You don’t have to automate everything right away. 
If you’re used to cutting and pasting into PowerPoint, just start cutting and pasting into <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio – it supports that.
When you’re ready to automate one of your charts, the full power of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio is waiting for you.
<p>(Agencies, this works for you, too!)</p>
It’s nice to deploy a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> and know you and your clients can visit it any time, and it automatically stays current.
With the information provided in this article, you can create a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> from scratch. 
And, if you clone that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> and tweak it for a client, those tweaks are evergreen to that client’s report. 
In short: <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio offers just the right balance of automation and improvisation.
Over the years, as <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> sources come and go, prices of data sources go up and down, and accessibility of data sources waxes and wanes, if there’s a data connector (or you can get the data into a Google Sheet), you can provide a consistent, seamless, professional reporting experience through it all.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio keeps getting better, and a couple of new features in 2025 have made a big impact on your reporting abilities:
New in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio is the ability to choose responsive report layouts. 
<p>The default has been the freeform layout built for desktops. The new responsive report works for different screen sizes, so people can view it on mobile devices.</p>
<p>For many of us, a pixel-perfect layout is unnecessary. Dropping charts into a preset grid offers rapid report development.</p>
<p>While this is only in the Pro version, it’s really handy!</p>
<p>With the new alerts feature, you can be notified of anomalies in your client performance as they occur.</p>
Alerts enable you to set thresholds for the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> in your Looker Studio reports. 
<p>Say you want to track your top three or top 10 rankings, or keep an eye on a specific keyword. </p>
<p>You can set custom alerts to get notified whenever those rankings change.</p>
<p>This is a great tool for enabling “management by exception,” where you only intervene when deviations from the norm occur.</p>
Next, I’ll show you step-by-step how to structure a basic but complete keyword rankings dashboard in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio.
<p>Here’s a sample of what we’ll be building: </p>
<p>Here are the calculated metrics we’ll develop along the way:</p>
The building blocks of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> campaigns are keywords and pages. 
<p>So, the results of your activities will be measured on keywords and pages in rankings.</p>
That said, there are three key elements to a high-performing keyword rankings dashboard for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> campaigns:
<p>Let’s discuss each of those further in this article.</p>
Log in to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio and start a blank report.
<p>Tip: If you’re already logged in, type “report.new” in your browser’s address bar to launch a fresh report instantly.</p>
At this point, I prefer to name and save the report before doing anything else, as I’ve found some glitchy behavior from <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio since they launched their responsive layout features.
Take advantage of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio’s new responsive layout features. 
<p>It lets you place charts with ease and looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.</p>
This is the first element of your keyword ranking <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a>. 
<p>The keyword detail table shows the individual keyword and page entries, which serve as the fundamental building blocks of your campaign. </p>
Our summary elements, the trend and scorecard charts, will be computed from the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> in this table.
<p>Select Google Sheets.</p>
<p>Choose your sheet.</p>
<p>You should see your keywords.</p>
The <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> model – the format of data provided by your data source – is:
To follow the patterns described in this guide, you can use any <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> source that provides these fields in some form or fashion. 
Depending on the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> connector, some tweaks to field names and data types may be necessary, but the basic principles apply.
If you want to follow along at home, the free Google Search Console <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> connector in the Looker Studio data source gallery, which can be connected to any GSC site you have access to, is one such compatible data source.
For this guide, we’ll be using a custom BigQuery <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> source as seen below:
It uses keyword and ranking <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> from the public dataset in the official Looker Studio Google Search Console report template. 
<p>(Note: The format has been modified slightly for this guide.)</p>
<p>Add Starting campaign date.</p>
Then Latest campaign date. (Typically, this is the most recent date for which <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> is available. This will soon be used in other formulas.):
<p>This is the most recent ranking position for your keyword.</p>
Now, you need to connect your keywords configuration with your ranking <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>. Looker Studio calls this blending data.
In the Setup tab, under <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> sources, click on Blend Data.
Blends let you connect and relate <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> from disparate sources.
<p>Ensure each field is present in the blend:</p>
Also, be sure to shift the keyword rankings <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> source to the left of the blend.
<p>Click the two save buttons and return to the report.</p>
<p>Add Landing Page as a dimension and Current Position as a metric.</p>
<p>Some folks find the decimal places on average rankings to be noisy. </p>
So if you’re using GSC as a ranking <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> source, you may configure the position formatting to omit them.
<p>Replace Landing Page with a calculated field that strips the website.</p>
<p>Since you’re just focused on keyword rankings here, let’s rename Query to Keyword.</p>
<p>In the Setup tab, click on the little ABC icon to the left of the Query dimension.</p>
<p>Here, you’ll fetch the keyword’s position 28 days before the latest position in your campaign. </p>
<p>This will be used to calculate your monthly gain.</p>
<p>The position at the start of the campaign:</p>
<p>Position improvement since the start of the campaign:</p>
<p>Make a similar one for Monthly Gain.</p>
<p>Add them to the keyword detail table:</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
The second element of your campaign <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> is the trend chart.
There are many ways to summarize an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> campaign’s performance. One practical way is through ranking tiers.
<p>How many keywords are ranked in the Top 3, Top 10, Top 30, etc., at any given moment?</p>
<p>The trend chart lets you see a visual summary of your ranking performance over time.</p>
<p>Repeat the previous step for each ranking tier until they’re all filled out as illustrated below.</p>
<p>This is where you can show the ranking trend of your campaign. People love graphics.</p>
<p>In your left table, drag each ranking tier from Available Fields to the Metrics section.</p>
<p>Also, add the Date field as highlighted below.</p>
<p>In the Setup tab, add your time series metrics.</p>
The final element in your keyword rankings <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> is the scorecard. 
<p>Scorecards attempt to sum up how well a campaign is going in a single number.</p>
<p>Our scoreboard metric will be your current ranking tiers: Keywords in the top three, top 10, etc.</p>
<p>Add a new section between your header and trend chart by hovering between them:</p>
<p>Repeat the last two steps to show a scorecard for each ranking tier across the top line.</p>
Congratulations, you’ve just configured your first <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio keyword rankings dashboard!
This isn’t just an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> dashboard, it’s an SEO dashboard builder. 
<p>Along the way, you’ll pick up the skills to evolve, extend, and tailor it to the needs of your business or clients.</p>
<p>Here’s what other folks are doing with it, and now you can too!</p>
<p>If you have a source of MSVs that you prefer, add them to a Google Sheet and blend them right into the report.</p>
If you’ve got MSV numbers, you can combine that with your position <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> and public SERP CTR tables to calculate estimated clicks based on ranking improvements. 
Estimated clicks can be a better signal than “actual” clicks (particularly in the first six months of campaigns) because of variance (like seasonality) and missing <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>.
<p>Instead of (or in addition to) estimated clicks, calculate how your campaign is doing relative to select competitors.</p>
<p>Add three (or N) trailing period columns to the keyword table, apply heatmap formatting to them, and you have an eye-catching rankings trend visualization. People love this.</p>
<p>Use whatever tiers you like!</p>
<p>Add a column to your keywords/pages Google Sheet called List. Now you can segment your keywords into separate campaigns. </p>
Add a drop-down list control to your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">dashboard</a> to switch between them, or summarize them all in aggregate. 
<p>Just watch for double-counting in the keywords table.</p>
<p>Add a calculated field that shows the seven-day or 28-day average. </p>
This is especially handy if your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>set doesn’t provide daily position samples or is running into Google’s SERP scraping mitigations. 
<p>If you track positions in certain SERP features, e.g., Google’s AI Overviews, add a calculated metric for that. It can be as simple as a Google Sheet.</p>
If you have the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>, add an icon field for SERP feature presence, like Answer Box. Use emojis for the icons.
With a blend of the free and official GSC or GA4 <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> connectors, you can insert traffic numbers right next to the rankings.
<p>A special mention for customizations to report on cause-and-effect.</p>
<p>More and more, we’re hearing that clients and prospects are dissatisfied with just charts and tables.</p>
<p>They want marketers to connect their activities to metric outcomes. They want marketers to demonstrate how their recommendations resulted in performance gains.</p>
With a little creativity, you can tailor <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">looker</a> Studio to provide these signals. Here are some tips:
<p>Include analyst task delivery</p>
<p>Make adding completed tasks to a Google Sheet part of your meeting process. </p>
If you already track tasks in Google Sheets, even easier. And you already learned above how to blend Google Sheet <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> into report tables.
<p>This easily scales out to automatically pulling tasks into reports from Basecamp, Monday.com, Trello, etc.</p>
<p>Include client task delivery</p>
It’s not just you who is responsible for tasks. For an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> campaign to work, the client is accountable for task completion, too.
<p>The best way to handle client task accountability is to make it transparent: Automatically blend a shared Google Sheet into your reporting with “assigned at” and “finished at” dates. </p>
<p>This is a really easy, low-friction way to nudge clients in the right direction.</p>
<p>Add annotations to the trend chart</p>
<p>If a new batch of page optimizations were deployed on a client site at a certain date, and the line chart goes up right after, you have a good case for causal lift.</p>
<p>(While it isn’t officially supported, folks have come up with plenty of easy workarounds – Google it.)</p>
