<p>Published on June 02, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Two years ago, in my early quest to understand what would become AI Overviews, I declared that Retrieval Augmented Generation was the future of search. With AI Overviews and now AI Mode wreaking havoc on organic search traffic, that future is here. </p>
<p>There’s a dearth of good information available about how these search appliances function so I recently went on a severe deep dive of AI Mode. But I think it’s worthwhile to do an abridged version, tie the two products together, offer some more strategic thinking about how we surf the next wave of generative search, and take up more of the AI Overviews about AI Mode with more of my content – at least for me. </p>
<p>The big picture difference between classic information retrieval (what governs the 10 blue links) and generative informational retrieval for the web (what governs conversational search) is that the former is deterministic and the latter is probabilistic. In short, this means that the old version of Google displayed content the same way you delivered it. The new version of Google makes a lot of choices about how content should be considered, stitched together, and displayed.</p>
<p>With classic search the content that you put in is parsed and analyzed, but the form in which it appears in the SERPs is just the elements you’ve provided extracted from that content. Google did not interpret the information prior to displaying it. You could change your ranking and performance by adjusting a series of mostly known levers that are features of content, system, site architecture, links, and user signals. </p>
<p>With generative search, you still prepare your content, system, site, and links to be accessible and parsed, but there are a series of highly variable and invisible reasoning steps that decide whether your content is eligible to be a part of the final response. These reasoning steps also infuse memory of user interactions. So, you can do all your typical SEO common practices, be considered, and not make it to the other side of the reasoning pipeline. LLMs can be temperamental, so the same content could go through the same pipeline twice and yield a different result.</p>
<p>AI Overviews and AI Mode are effectively governed by the same mechanisms. We’ll examine the following patents that explain the bulk of how they function:</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is the short version and although I share some unique insights here too, you can check out the long form version if you want a deep dive on how AI Mode works.</p>
<p>AI Mode works by pulling first understanding and forming the context of the user that will inform all the downstream tasks. That context combined with the query informs the generation of a series of synthetic queries. Passages are pulled from documents that rank for the query set and then classification is done for the query that informs which of a series of LLMs will be used. The passages are then run through a series of reasoning chains and those that make it through are synthesized into a response. That response is refined based on the embeddings-based user profile, citations are pulled and then the response is rendered for the user.</p>
<p>There are several variants of this process contemplated in the Search with stateful chat patent application. Let’s walk through one of the figures step by step, mapping to the system logic. The architecture of Google’s AI Mode, as depicted in FIG. 9 of the patent application, represents a multi-stage, reasoning-informed system that transitions from query interpretation to synthetic expansion to downstream natural language response generation. Each step of this flow has major implications for how visibility is earned, and why traditional SEO tactics are insufficient in this environment.</p>
<p>At the moment of user input, the system ingests the query, but unlike classical search engines, this is just the spark, not the complete unit of work. The query is treated as a trigger for a broader information synthesis process rather than a deterministic retrieval request. All the remaining walkthroughs start here, so I will skip describing this step as we review AI Overviews.</p>
<p>The system pulls user and device-level contextual information: prior queries in the session, location, account-linked behaviors (e.g., Gmail, Maps), device signals, and persistent memory. This helps the system ground the query in temporal and behavioral context.</p>
<p>A foundation model (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) processes the query and context to produce reasoning outputs. This may include inferred user intent, ambiguity resolution, and classification cues. This step initiates the system’s internal understanding of what the user is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>The LLM output guides the creation of multiple synthetic queries that reflect various reformulations of the original intent. These could include related, implicit, comparative, recent, or historically co-queried terms, forming a constellation of search intents. This is the query fan out process that we will discuss further below.</p>
<p>Search result documents are pulled from the index, not just in response to the original query, but in response to the entire fan-out of synthetic queries. The system builds a “custom corpus” of highly relevant documents across multiple sub-intents.</p>
<p>Using the query, the contextual information, the synthetic queries, and the candidate documents, the system assigns a classification to the query. This determines what type of answer is needed, explanatory, comparative, transactional, hedonic, etc.</p>
<p>Based on the classification, the system selects from a series of specialized models,e.g., ones tuned for summarization, structured extraction, translation, or decision-support. Each model plays a role in turning raw documents into useful synthesis.</p>
<p>These downstream models produce the final response using natural language, potentially stitching together multiple passages across sources and modalities (text, video, audio).</p>
<p>The synthesized natural language response is sent to the user, often with citations or interactive UI elements derived from the retrieved corpus. If your content is cited, it may drive traffic. But often, the response satisfies the user directly, reducing the need to click through.</p>
<p>AI Mode is a complete paradigm shift. Ranking is matrixed and the standard SEO tactics only get your content considered. We will need to do a lot of experimenting as a community to figure out what it takes to reliably make our content be cited, but those efforts may not yield any meaningful traffic. The user behavior in AI Mode is more reflective of a branding channel, so we’ll need to measure accordingly.</p>
<p>Although AI Overviews have been previously examined, there is value in revisiting them in context of the new information that has surfaced from examining AI Mode. For instance, the query fan-out technique has not been considered in the various AI Overview studies that compare the classic ranking overlap with AI Overview performance. The matrix of queries used to generate these responses will help us uncover what to do.</p>
<p>There are several methods contemplated in the Generative summaries for search results patent application, but I want two distinct approaches to AI Overviews. In one, Gemini generates the response first and then looks to corroborate it with content. In the other it pulls the content and then generates the response.</p>
<p>This version of the AI Overview workflow shows how Google builds a response using expanded query sets, drawing from semantically and behaviorally adjacent searches. Instead of simply retrieving results for the explicit user query, the system proactively pulls documents associated with related, recent, and implied queries using a more simplistic version of the query fan-out technique than what’s used for AI Mode. From that broader corpus, a summary is generated and then verified before presentation. This is a hybrid of fan-out retrieval and reasoning-driven synthesis. Let’s walk through the process step-by-step and what those steps mean for SEO.</p>
<p>Google retrieves a set of documents that respond directly to the user’s query. These are selected using a combination of query-dependent (text match, semantic similarity), query-independent (document authority, embeddings), and user-dependent (personalization) signals.</p>
<p>The system identifies documents responsive to other known queries that share semantic overlap or behavioral co-occurrence with the original. These documents are added to the retrieval set based on their relevance to related query variants.</p>
<p>Next the system retrieves documents that respond to queries the user recently submitted. These may reflect evolving intent or ongoing research behavior in a search journey.</p>
<p>Finally, the system pulls documents for implied queries inferred by the LLM from the phrasing or deeper intent of the original input. These are semantically rich, intent-predicted queries generated in the background.</p>
<p>With all document sets assembled, the system uses an LLM to generate a summary answer. It synthesizes content from text, image, or video sources, and may include source citations directly within the summary.</p>
<p>The model may attach source identifiers to passages or indicate confidence levels in certain answers based on how strong the match was between the summary and retrieved documents.</p>
<p>The final output is rendered to the user. Citations may be added as links to verifying sources (262A). Confidence annotations may be displayed (262B), but I imagine this is only for internal purposes. LLM outputs and document comparisons determine what gets cited and how prominently.</p>
<p>The AI Overview system, as depicted in FIG. 3 of the patent application, outlines a generative retrieval-and-verification architecture. In this version the system generates the response first then generates a response from the search results and compares them to the original version. It loops through this process until a validated version of the response can be returned.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through the process step-by-step and consider what it means for SEO. </p>
<p>The system uses a LLM to generate an answer. This output is not simply pulled from one document, it may be synthesized from content tied to the query itself, to related queries, or to recent queries issued by the same user. Additionally, the model may use rewrites or paraphrases of the original query to expand the scope of the answer.</p>
<p>After generating the full summary, the system selects individual segments or claims that need to be verified against actual documents.</p>
<p>Now the system needs to confirm that the generated claim is supported by actual published material. It does this in two ways: by semantically comparing the summary portion to passages in previously retrieved documents (358A), or by issuing a new search using the summary portion itself as a query (358B).</p>
<p>The system compares the candidate document passage to the generated summary portion to determine if it verifies the claim. This is a semantic alignment check between the summary and candidate content.</p>
<p>If verification succeeds, the system proceeds to cite the passage. If it fails, it tries another candidate document.</p>
<p>If a passage is verified, the corresponding segment of the summary is linked as its citation, typically with a scroll-to-text reference that sends the user to the verified source.</p>
<p>If the summary contains additional unverified segments, the system loops to identify and verify them as well.</p>
<p>Once all portions are verified (or at least those that can be), the AI-generated summary with inline citations is presented to the user.</p>
<p>AI Overviews don’t rank content – they remix it and use existing content to validate it. And to be remixed, your content must win at the intersection of language model comprehension and multi-query relevance.</p>
<p>The query fan-out technique is the invisible sauce behind both AI Overviews and AI Mode. Google extrapolates a series of so-called synthetic queries based on the explicit query, implicit information needs, and user behavior. These queries are used to inform what other documents are retrieved to inform “grounding” of the results. Although we will likely never get visibility into this data, both Andreas Volpini and I have separately made tools to help understand what those queries might be.</p>
<p>This diagram from the Systems and Methods for Prompt-Based Query Generation for Diverse Retrieval patent application shows how Google trains a query expansion model. Unlike traditional keyword expansion, this system uses LLMs to generate synthetic query-document pairs and trains a document retrieval model that can interpret user queries more broadly, drawing on multiple prompts to generate diverse interpretations of intent.</p>
<p>The previous patents already told us how it works, but let’s break down the training workflow step by step and explain the SEO implications of each stage.</p>
<p>The system begins by receiving at least two prompts that describe the retrieval task it is meant to solve. These prompts instruct a large language model on how to generate variations of queries that could retrieve relevant content from a given corpus.</p>
<p>Based on the prompts and the document corpus, the system uses an LLM to create a synthetic training dataset. Each entry is a pair: a synthetically generated query and a document from the corpus that could answer it. This effectively teaches the model which types of questions a given piece of content can satisfy, even if no user has ever searched that way before.</p>
<p>The model is trained to understand the relationships between synthetic queries and relevant documents. This results in a document retriever that can accept real-world queries and infer which documents, across many latent intents, are most appropriate.</p>
<p>Once trained, the model becomes the retrieval engine deployed in systems like AI Overviews and AI Mode. It sits behind the scenes, taking a user’s query and triggering a fan-out of related, implicit, comparative, and historically-relevant queries, retrieving content for each and then merging the results into a generative synthesis.</p>
<p>The query fan-out technique will make these efforts more like reputation management campaigns. Since there’s focus on source diversity to verify information, marketers will look to spread their messages across multiple pages and many sites to ensure that Google encounters their content no matter what they retrieve.</p>
<p>One of the more fascinating features Google is bringing to AI Mode is Personal Context. Soon you’ll be able to integrate much of your data from across the Google ecosystem into Search to inform personalization of responses. While a compelling feature (with wide-reaching privacy implications) it also poses complications for measurement.</p>
<p>This diagram from FIG. 4 of the patent application titled User Embedding Models for Personalization of Sequence Processing Models reveals how Google’s systems, particularly in AI Mode, incorporate user-specific context embeddings to personalize how queries are interpreted and answered.</p>
<p>Rather than treating every query as standalone, this system builds a persistent vector-based profile for each user based on their interaction history, preferences, and behavior. That profile then conditions how AI Mode interprets queries and ranks or generates responses.</p>
<p>Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the process, aligned with SEO implications for each stage.</p>
<p>The system collects a wide range of user-associated signals including prior search queries, engagement with content, browsing behavior, clicks, time on page, location, device type, and more.</p>
<p>An embedding model processes the user data and creates a dense vector representation of that user’s contextual profile. This becomes the personalization signal that gets paired with incoming queries.</p>
<p>The system receives a task instruction. In the case of AI Mode, this is typically a search query or user prompt.</p>
<p>The query or prompt itself is also embedded, using a separate vector space. The system now has two primary inputs: the user’s contextual embedding and the query’s semantic embedding.</p>
<p>The system fuses the user profile embeddings and the query embeddings. Together, they inform what content is retrieved or synthesized. The model’s final output is conditioned on this fusion, which means it’s personalized at the reasoning level, not just in ranking order.</p>
<p>To win here, your content must:</p>
<p>Relevance is no longer just about matching the query. It’s about fitting the reasoning process that starts with who the user is. AI Mode is the end of “one-size-fits-all” content optimization and beginning of an even more fractured information discovery experience.</p>
<p>Reasoning in LLMs refers to the model’s ability to go beyond surface-level pattern matching and instead perform multi-step, logical, or inferential thinking to reach a conclusion. Rather than simply retrieving or repeating information, an LLM engaged in reasoning evaluates relationships between concepts, applies context, weighs alternatives, and generates responses that reflect deliberate thought. This allows it to answer complex questions, draw comparisons, make decisions, or synthesize information across multiple sources much like a human would when “thinking through” a problem. Google’s AI surfaces employ this process to determine what information should be used in a final response. </p>
<p>The diagram in FIG. 7 from the Instruction Fine-Tuning Machine-Learned Models Using Intermediate Reasoning Steps patent application represents a training-time process for Google’s machine-learned sequence models, including LLMs that power AI Overviews and AI Mode. It shows how reasoning is explicitly trained and evaluated, not just by measuring final answers, but by analyzing the intermediate steps the model takes to reach those answers known as a reasoning trace.</p>
<p>This diagram is essential to understanding why SEO needs to evolve. If the model is being trained to reason step-by-step, then our content needs to support not just retrieval, but inference. Below is a breakdown of each step in the reasoning training process, and the corresponding SEO implication.</p>
<p>The system begins by collecting a diverse set of training examples. These pairs of queries and expected outputs are used to train a machine-learned sequence model like a large language model.</p>
<p>For each training example, the model receives a query. This is the start of the reasoning chain.</p>
<p>The query is run through the LLM, initiating a forward pass to produce a predicted response.</p>
<p>The model doesn’t just output an answer. It produces a structured record of the intermediate steps or latent decisions it used to arrive at the answer. These might include document selection, passage scoring, fact extraction, or sub-question chaining.</p>
<p>The output is compared to a human-annotated correct response to determine whether the model got the answer right.</p>
<p>Even if the final answer is correct, the steps used to get there are also evaluated. If the model took a path that’s illogical, inefficient, or not human-aligned, it’s penalized, even if it got the right answer.</p>
<p>The model is fine-tuned using the results of both evaluations. This ensures it’s not just learning what to say, but how to think like a human searcher or subject matter expert.</p>
<p>The diagram from FIG. 4 of the patent application titled Method for Text Ranking with Pairwise Ranking Prompting shows how  AI Mode performs reasoning-based re-ranking by comparing passages against one another in pairs. This technique bypasses traditional scoring models like BM25 or simple vector similarity, and instead uses LLMs to judge relevance in context.</p>
<p>What this means in practice is that your content is not scored in isolation. It’s scored in a head-to-head comparison against competing passages. And the decision is made by a generative model performing reasoning tasks, not just measuring term overlap.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the workflow, aligned with SEO implications at each stage.</p>
<p>The system generates a prompt that includes a user query, a first passage (text from one candidate document), and a second passage (from another candidate). These are framed in a way that allows a language model to evaluate which is more relevant.</p>
<p>This prompt is submitted to a generative sequence processing model (such as Gemini 2.5 or similar). The model reads the query and both candidate passages, and is expected to compare them on semantic grounds.</p>
<p>Headlines, formatting, and embedded summaries all help here. So do strong introductory sentences that convey clear value.</p>
<p>The LLM evaluates which of the two passages better satisfies the user’s query. It may do this using internal chain-of-thought reasoning or learned relevance heuristics based on fine-tuned training.</p>
<p>The model outputs a result of which of the two passages should be ranked higher for the query. This decision can be recorded as part of a training loop or used in real-time to determine which content enters the AI Mode synthesis.</p>
<p>These patents confirm that reasoning is now part of the ranking pipeline. Your content isn’t just being retrieved, it’s being tested for how well it contributes to the model’s thought process. You’re not just optimizing for keywords. You’re optimizing for inference.</p>
<p>There is a lot of overlap between how AI Overviews and AI Mode function. Our mental model of how search works is also evolving, so I share the following table as a cheat sheet to help clarify the differences. </p>
<p>There’s a persistent argument in the SEO community claiming that optimizing for AI surfaces (AI Overviews, AI Mode, or other conversational search platforms) isn’t a new discipline. It’s just SEO. That argument feels familiar. It’s the same tired energy we saw in the never-ending subdomain vs. subdirectory debate, or the endless 301 vs. 302 discourse. But this one is more consequential because it’s not just a technical disagreement. It’s a missed opportunity to reframe the entire value proposition of search.</p>
<p>We are at a real inflection point. The first in decades where we can reframe the value proposition of search itself. And yet within our own ranks (heh), we’re minimizing it, trying to fold it into a decades-old discipline that’s increasingly defined by low expectations and misaligned incentives. That opportunity should not be shrugged off in favor of protecting legacy definitions and navigating the fear of one’s eroding expertise. </p>
<p>Yes, technically, this could be rolled under the SEO umbrella. We’ve done that before. In fact, we do it every time Google socially engineers our community to execute its goals. But doing so now would be a massive strategic mistake.</p>
<p>AI has the world’s attention. Conversational interfaces are becoming the new front door to information discovery. And these new surfaces are largely unclaimed as a marketing channel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SEO is already burdened with perceptions that limit its influence. In the C-Suite, SEO is viewed as a cost-saving channel. It’s associated with “free traffic.” And ironically, that framing, coined by the very people who built this channel into the web’s top referral source, has damaged our ability to command budgets, headcount, or strategic consideration in line with the value we create.</p>
<p>The “it’s just SEO” mindset doesn’t just miss the nuance. It reinforces a ceiling that’s been holding this field back for years. It keeps us stuck in the KPIs of yesterday, when what we need is a seat at the table in shaping the next frontier of information access. What’s happening in AI search isn’t just a new SERP layout. It’s a fundamental rearchitecture where language models reason about content, rank passages, and deliver synthesized answers.</p>
<p>That’s not just SEO. That’s something new.</p>
<p>There’s another algorithmic channel where content is the price of entry. It’s unpredictable. It’s difficult to attribute. It’s rarely expected to drive conversions on day one. And yet, the C-Suite doesn’t need projections, they just keep investing. </p>
<p>That channel? Social media.</p>
<p>And what is social media marketing, really? It’s just channel-specific content strategy. But social media marketers didn’t bury it inside content strategy. They gave it a name. So the C-Suite gave it budget. They gave it power. And it became a category.</p>
<p>We can, and should, do the same for conversational search.</p>
<p>When people say this is just SEO, they’re referencing an idealized version of the discipline that exists more in theory than in practice.</p>
<p>At iPullRank we actually do these things, so when I talk about them at conferences or in blog posts, I’ve often been told that the type of work we do sets an unrealistically high bar. That bar includes things like computational linguistics, deep understanding of retrieval systems, entity and true semantic optimization, and the ability to build software when the market doesn’t offer tools that do what we need. Our clients hire us because we give real answers, not just “it depends.” And they tell us that our work is more thorough than what they’ve seen from other SEO agencies.</p>
<p>That’s because most of the industry isn’t doing SEO at this level. It’s running old playbooks they found online and they deliver direct exports from tools dressed up as insight. So when someone says optimizing AI Overviews and AI Mode are “just SEO,” what they’re really saying is that the understanding of dense retrieval systems, passage-level semantic modeling, and reasoning are already commonplace. And that’s just not true because SEO software does not account for them.</p>
<p>This isn’t a knock on the broader industry. It’s a call for honesty in a discussion that is limiting our ability to evolve. Most SEO today is tactical, reactive, and stuck in a paradigm optimized for ranking documents, not improving the reasoning capabilities of passages.</p>
<p>Instead, what’s happening is people are following the same old best practices, using the same obsolete tools, and seeing diminishing returns, which further erodes confidence in SEO. </p>
<p>Are we here to do an expensive form of arts and crafts? Or are we here to drive business results? I know what I’m here for, so the argument is over for me.</p>
<p>And perception drives investment.</p>
<p>Calling it “just SEO” ensures we remain undervalued, underfunded, and misunderstood which is especially bad at a time when visibility, attribution, and even clicks themselves are being abstracted behind generative interfaces.</p>
<p>Former SEO evangelist Rand Fishkin said it best at SEO Week in his “Your Bigger than SEO talk.” SEO has a branding problem that it is not likely to overcome.</p>
<p>So a shift to Relevance Engineering (r17g) this isn’t just semantics. This is strategy.</p>
<p>We have a chance to define the category before someone else does. Let’s not waste it defending the past.</p>
