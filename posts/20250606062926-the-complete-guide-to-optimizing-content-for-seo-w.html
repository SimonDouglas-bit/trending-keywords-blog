<p>There’s nothing worse than pouring your heart and soul into a wonderful guide or blog post that nobody ever sees or churning out pieces with little value that disappoint or alienate your potential audience.</p>

<p>If you have used AI during your content creation process, you should: </p>
<p>When you’re working on content, there are some basics that shouldn’t be ignored. Good spelling, grammar, and readability are a must. </p>

<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>If you’ve followed the steps above, you’ll be armed with a content plan based on research and many relevant keywords. </p>
<p>But you can still fall into common traps, like focusing too much on a primary keyword or overusing search terms.   </p>
<p>Helpful, great quality website content should:</p>
<p>Having strong E-E-A-T (experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness) can greatly impact SEO success. Trustworthy, authoritative content should:  </p>
<p>Depending on your topic, other media may help to enrich your content for users and improve your SEO efforts.</p>
<p>Check the search engines to see what type of content they are already ranking for a certain search query. Perhaps video or visual content is prevalent. </p>
<p>If so, make sure your content includes some original video or imagery too, where possible. Consider whether your pages would benefit from:</p>
<p>Every piece of content is related to others. Great content will add to your area of expertise and will relate to other pieces of content on your site. </p>
<p>It will also draw references from other trusted resources on a topic. And in time, it might become a piece that others refer to.</p>
<p>While creating your content, it’s important to consider:</p>
<p>While technical SEO issues can affect your whole site, there are some specific ones to look out for to help optimize for SEO performance. As a quick overview, you should make sure:</p>
<p>The best content is never finished. The world changes fast, and that leaves content online that is dated, inaccurate, or at worst, misleading. It’s important to be aware of this and revisit your content often. </p>
