<p>Strategic and tactical guidance for marketplace success in the new (AI) SEO world, featuring a five-phase framework that goes beyond basic optimization.</p>
<p>Below, I’ve got an update on my marketplace SEO issue – and this edition is more robust, taking into account learnings from the UX study of AIOs as well as the latest shifts in the search landscape.</p>
<p>(Shifts that, I’d argue, have a disproportionate impact on online marketplaces.)</p>
<p>Plus, premium subscribers will get my five-phase framework to ensure you’re approaching marketplace SEO from an overall product growth perspective … and my top considerations for marketplaces to stay ahead of competitors and LLMs. (That’s all at the end of this issue. You can subscribe to get full access here.)</p>
<p>Also, a quick thanks to Amanda Johnson, who partnered with me to bring this marketplace SEO issue into 2025.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there are two major types of SEO: product-led and marketing-led.</p>
<p>Marketplace SEO (as I call it) is a product-led SEO function of your organization. Without it, companies like Tripadvisor, Zillow, Meta, or Glassdoor wouldn’t be where they are today.</p>
<p>The key lessons about marketplaces from my time at G2 and my work with Nextdoor, Bounce, and others: Good SEO is the result of product growth, not just website optimization.</p>
<p>It’s a different way to think about and execute SEO because marketplaces have massive scale advantages over other types of businesses.</p>
<p>But AI threatens this moat.</p>
<p>And this is mission critical: 80% of new users coming from SEO is not uncommon for marketplaces. Yes, even in the current SEO landscape.</p>
<p>In fact, I called this out in March 2025 in CheggMate – that information sites, especially marketplaces, are being disproportionately affected in search by AIOs and LLMs.</p>
<p>Why understanding marketplace SEO matters: Most sites on the web are not marketplaces. The approach to marketplace SEO is very different from non-marketplace sites. Applying the wrong approach severely limits the impact on company growth.</p>
<p>If you’re running a marketplace site (which I also sometimes call an SEO aggregator), your goal is to become a trusted source that retrieval layers (RAG), AI Overviews, and chatbots pull from directly.</p>
<p>This requires opening your site to AI crawlers, baking in rich schema, exposing structured APIs or data feeds for RAG pipelines, and continually fueling fresh, authoritative UGC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AI tools are churning out optimized titles, descriptions, and rich snippets across millions of pages faster than any human team could.</p>
<p>Essentially, marketplace SEO has evolved into a true product-growth partnership, where UX, community incentives, and AI visibility all work together to keep up visibility with our audiences.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how to do that.</p>
<p>But first, we have to get on the same page about what marketplace SEO entails (because you know how our industry likes to throw around new buzzphrases every day).</p>
<p>Marketplace SEO is the practice of optimizing a site based on its inventory (supply) so that potential buyers (demand) land directly on your marketplace when they’re about to make a decision, like a software purchase, booking a flight, scheduling a medical appointment, etc.</p>
<p>Marketplaces often rely on user-generated reviews and commentary (plus the right technical signals) to build trust and relevance.</p>
<p>Think of marketplace SEO as the art – and science – of making two-sided platforms (like G2, Tripadvisor, ZocDoc, or Nextdoor) impossible to miss.</p>
<p>Their unique advantage comes from having a large number of pages on their site across a few different templates, which leads to multiplier effects for internal linking, testing, and target audience size.</p>
<p>Marketplaces orchestrate thousands (even millions) of user-generated listings, reviews, and seller storefronts so that search engines point back to the service you provide: connecting consumers to solutions they need.</p>
<p>In short, marketplace SEO is about optimizing the entire ecosystem – beyond the homepage or blog – to turbocharge discoverability for every seller, every listing, every time.</p>
<p>They definitely share DNA, but marketplace SEO stands on its own.</p>
<p>Like product-led SEO, we embed optimization into the product experience itself, using user actions (reviews, ratings, uploads) as our content engine.</p>
<p>But on a marketplace site, we also juggle multi-vendor dynamics, inventory churn, and network effects that a standalone SaaS app doesn’t face.</p>
<p>At G2, for example, we saw real SEO gains from optimizing the review submission process (by encouraging longer reviews to create more content), which wouldn’t necessarily fall into product-led SEO.</p>
<p>So yes, it’s product-led in spirit because we grow through the product and improvements to the marketplace, but it demands marketplace-specific plays to keep the flywheel spinning.</p>
<p>With marketplace SEO, you’re playing in the same sandbox as product-led SEO, but perhaps with a few extra toys.</p>
<p>If the overwhelming majority of new users heading to marketplaces are coming from organic search, understanding the differences between regular old SEO and marketplace SEO is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p>In addition to these core differences, marketplaces are aggregators. (You can read more about my thoughts on SEO integrators vs. aggregators here.)</p>
<p>What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>I show examples of different aggregator types here: SEO Strategy Archetypes.</p>
<p>When thinking about marketplace SEO, most marketers jump straight into solving technical SEO problems, like title/content/internal link optimization.</p>
<p>While doing those things is not wrong (I mean, they’ve got to be done), focusing only on these practices will limit the scale of SEO impact you can have.</p>
<p>To earn that sweet, sweet organic visibility, you must think about architecting your marketplace like an AI-friendly product. This isn’t something you can skip.</p>
<p>To compete in an AI-first world, your platform must be:</p>
<p>For marketplaces, SEO is product design.</p>
<p>When you treat search as a core feature – designing facets, filters, and dynamic landing pages around user intent – you’re not just optimizing for discovery, you’re crafting the entire search experience.</p>
<p>Finally, what happens after the click is just as critical as earning it:</p>
<p>The Growth Memo’s UX study of AIOs confirmed that the “second-click” or “validation click” is more important than ever … if you’re fortunate enough to get that organic click, your UX and brand trust signals have to be on point.</p>
<p>If you bake streamlined post-click moments into your roadmap, you can turn that initial brand visibility into real engagement and trust.</p>
<p>Amanda jumping in here and getting all meta with a first-person note: We cannot stress enough how important the on-page experience after that earned organic click truly is. I can’t even begin to count how many times I’ve left a marketplace because of the UX hurdles or poor site search functions, only to go back to Google, ChatGPT, or just go directly to seller websites and circumvent marketplaces as a whole – despite my strong desire to compare options and read reviews outside of the actual seller’s platform.</p>
<p>To scale marketplace SEO successfully, you need to optimize across the whole range of product growth: website, product, and network effects.</p>
<p>Think of marketplace SEO as a product-wide system, not a simple checklist or set of tactics.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to consider to run your marketplace SEO program from a product growth approach:</p>
<p>This is a no-brainer but still deserves mention here. Optimizing the website for organic search and LLM visibility is, of course, an essential part of marketplace SEO.</p>
<p>But the most important areas of optimization for marketplaces are:</p>
<p>Each of these areas provides enough depth to fill roadmaps for years.</p>
<p>The key to winning is doing the basics incredibly well and building an experimentation engine that surfaces new wins and levers.</p>
<p>Amanda jumping in here again: If possible, don’t skip video. Yes, even if UGC videos require an internal quality control program/review in place. Underestimating the power of organic and even low-fi videos showcasing the product or user’s final decision (i.e., to go on a trip to Rome or sign up for new software based on a core feature) can earn you visibility in AIOs and LLMs. A recent client of mine earned a significant video-embed AIO mention with very clear brand visibility for a core targeted query … all with a short, simple video explaining the concept and how their product helped. It was easy to do. You bet we’ll be running tests to see if we can accomplish that on repeat.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this Tripadvisor example below, where every element is intentional and tested.</p>
<p>The site didn’t start like that, but it evolved over time. TripAdvisor has SEO deeply ingrained in its DNA. You can rest assured that every element is there for a reason.</p>
<p>And the interface has been updated and improved with the incorporation of AI, to include:</p>
<p>For further reading (and another marketplace SEO example), check out Marketplace Deep Dive – Q1 (Case Study: Zillow).</p>
<p>The product experience for marketplaces spans the sign-up, content creation, and admin experience (sometimes more).</p>
<p>It’s vital for SEO to be involved in product optimizations and improvements because it directly impacts the number and quality of pages.</p>
<p>Strategic questions SEO pros should ask themselves:</p>
<p>Amanda jumping in here one more time: Please, I beg of you on behalf of all strategists everywhere – allow your SEO and content strategists the room and resources to test … and even fail. Above, Kevin calls out the need to build a continuous testing engine, and if you want to push forward in building organic visibility and authority in this new era of search, whether you’re a marketplace or an integrator site that’s a direct seller, testing is crucial. Teams that test (albeit wisely), fail, learn, and grow are going to be the ones who come out ahead during this chaotic season in search.</p>
<p>Marketplaces are able to develop powerful network effects that accelerate growth and defend themselves from challengers.</p>
<p>Network effects = competitive advantages that grow with the company. Network effects get better over time (like production cost) and become your organization’s edge.</p>
<p>They can become protective moats, but only when they’re successful and mature.</p>
<p>Examples of network effects can include factors like:</p>
<p>SEO Integrators don’t have access to the same network effects that SEO Aggregators (like marketplaces) do. Economies of scale are an example of this.</p>
<p>It would be absurd to say SEO needs to own network effects – it’s a company effort.</p>
<p>But SEO, as the largest user acquisition channel for marketplaces, needs to be aware and work toward building network effects.</p>
<p>G2, for example, has developed such a prominent reputation that the G2 badge is a sign of credibility for software buyers.</p>
<p>That, of course, wasn’t the case when G2 (crowd) started. It developed over time and with sustained quality.</p>
<p>As a result, companies pay to add the badge to their sites and drive new reviews, which adds to the overall value of the marketplace.</p>
<p>In this example, UserGuiding not only adds them to their site in the footer, but also publishes a piece of content each year, noting their annual badge increase.3</p>
<p>Overall, the product growth approach to marketplace SEO has experimentation and funnel analysis that leads to continuous improvement at its core – that’s not what you would typically expect in classic SEO plays.</p>
<p>A lot is changing – and at rapid speeds – due to LLM search. This affects aggregator sites that rely on marketplace SEO practices to stay visible.</p>
<p>Here are a few considerations to help you stay ahead and grounded in future thinking.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Plan content quality for both LLMs and actual humans:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study human usage patterns:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrutinize your marketplace’s internal search:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work toward visibility resilience, no matter what happens in search:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversify your marketing channels if you haven’t already:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Experiment with live-commerce, social-commerce, and brand collaborations to fill gaps beyond search.</p>
