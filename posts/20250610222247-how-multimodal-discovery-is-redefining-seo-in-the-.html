<p>Published on June 10, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>The SEO industry is undergoing a seismic shift – one shaped not just by algorithms but also by evolving user expectations. </p>
<p>At the heart of it is a radical transformation in how people search, and Google is adapting in real time.</p>
<p>Between the 2025 Google I/O Keynote and meetings with search experts and engineers, it’s clear: we’re entering a multimodal, AI-powered era of discovery. </p>
<p>At the forefront of this change is that search is no longer just a list of blue links.</p>
<p>It’s a personalized, visual, voice-enabled, and AI-summarized interface designed to anticipate the user’s intent, not just respond to it.</p>
<p>Search behavior has evolved. Users now:</p>
<p>In response, Google is evolving from a reactive query engine into a proactive AI discovery system. </p>
<p>We are in the midst of a transformation from semantic to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and the expectation that consumers (searchers) are evolving the discovery journey. </p>
<p>AI Overviews, Gemini-powered queries, and real-time personalization via context from Gmail, Maps, and Calendar now influence results across verticals like travel, tickets, shopping, and SaaS solutions. </p>
<p>These changes are visible and measurable.</p>
<p>But here’s the reality: SEOs who don’t adapt their content, structure, and measurement models will become invisible in this new ecosystem.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: The next wave of search: AI Mode, deep research and beyond</p>
<p>With the rollout of AI Overviews, Google is now summarizing answers directly, often without requiring a click or even clearly attributing a single source. </p>
<p>While this may improve the user experience, it introduces a new challenge for content creators, SEO, and web development teams.</p>
<p>Google’s updated guidance on “Succeeding in AI Search” was a key theme during the 2025 Google I/O event.</p>
<p>Google’s guidance and recommendations to the web community will continue to emphasize originality, experience, structured data, and actionability.</p>
<p>This new guidance evolves “helpful content” to what I call value-rich content. </p>
<p>This level of content is not only useful but also understandable, attributable, and uniquely valuable, especially when answering layered, context-rich expectations. </p>
<p>It is rewarded in an AI-driven search experience. </p>
<p>Search is no longer text-first. </p>
<p>It’s multimodal, integrating text, images, video, voice, and interactive components in one fluid interface. </p>
<p>Google’s Gemini-powered AI now interprets contextual signals across formats.</p>
<p>To stay visible, your content must be more than just readable: it must be visually and structurally rich.</p>
<p>To win in AI-driven SERPs, you must:</p>
<p>During Google I/O, Liz Reid and even engineers after her keynote, noted that users are:</p>
<p>In one example shared during the session, an engineer described how Google’s AI handled a search for comparing rental car gas mileage by surfacing not just summary data, but linking users directly to visual content and deeper reviews.</p>
<p>Another Googler added that AI reviews are already influencing the type of content surfaced, stating:</p>
<p>In this context, static documentation or feature articles alone won’t be enough.</p>
<p>If content doesn’t visually show how something works, or provide structured signals that Google can parse across formats, it’s likely to be skipped over in favor of content that does.</p>
<p>This shift isn’t optional – it’s foundational to ranking in a world where search looks less like a listicle and more like a guided assistant.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: SEO in an AI-powered world: What changed in just a year</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>The era of traffic-first SEO measurement is rapidly coming to an end.</p>
<p>As Google continues to roll out AI Overviews and AI Mode, the ability to track traditional user behavior, such as clicks, bounce rate, and even basic session attribution, is diminishing. </p>
<p>Google has confirmed that clicks from AI Mode are currently untrackable in Google Search Console or standard analytics platforms.</p>
<p>This has major implications. Teams are still being asked to measure SEO success by click-through rates and traffic volume, while the reality is that:</p>
<p>As one Googler explained:</p>
<p>This disconnect between what the executive dashboard expects and what the user experience actually delivers is putting pressure on SEO teams, analysts, and web leads alike.</p>
<p>What’s needed is a redefinition of success metrics. Modern SEO KPIs must include:</p>
<p>In a world where AI is the first and last touchpoint, the SEO team’s role is to ensure that content is findable, referenced, and trusted, even if it’s not immediately clicked. </p>
<p>For organizations still measuring performance with a 2015 dashboard, this shift in mindset is urgent and existential.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: 12 new KPIs for the generative AI search era</p>
<p>Google is building a search engine for the future of information consumption, not the past, Wikipedia-style content investments. </p>
<p>Web developers, SEO professionals, and content teams must evolve now or risk irrelevance. </p>
<p>Here’s what we can do today:</p>
<p>Most importantly, embrace the complexity with AI search optimization. </p>
<p>The future of search isn’t just about keywords. </p>
<p>It’s about helping people make better decisions through richer, more intuitive discovery experiences.</p>
<p>SEO at large is uniquely positioned to lead in this new era. </p>
<p>No other discipline blends content, data, structure, user experience, and technical systems as seamlessly. </p>
<p>In a multimodal, AI-driven search landscape, SEOs aren’t being left behind – we’re being called to lead.</p>
