<p>On-page optimization is a crucial part of any SEO strategy. It includes optimizations made directly to the elements of a webpage to improve rankings in search engines and provide a better user experience.</p>
<p>While off-page techniques like link building, citations, and brand demand also play a role, you have full control over on-page factors, making them the foundation of SEO success.</p>
<p>This article covers the key elements that should be optimized on every page for the best SEO results. This includes both content-focused aspects and technical elements.</p>
<p>On-page SEO is about improving the different parts of a webpage so that both people and search engines can easily figure out what the page is about. It includes making the page more user-friendly and providing helpful information.</p>
<p>This includes the:</p>
<p>On-page SEO is completely under your control, and that’s why some companies can go overboard trying to make everything perfect for search engines. Still, “over-optimizing” your webpages can harm user experience and lead to devaluations.</p>
<p>When you create a good user experience by focusing on the visitor’s or potential visitor’s needs vs. your own, you have likely created the perfect experience for a search engine. </p>
<p>The job of the search engine is to display the most relevant result to a query in the easiest-to-absorb format and in the fastest way possible. By creating your on-page experience to do this, you are doing SEO. </p>
<p>Aim to design your content to meet user needs, deliver information effectively, and remain accessible to all users, including those with disabilities and without a reliable internet connection.</p>
<p>Below are the on-page elements to optimize.</p>
<p>Content can take the form of text, videos, images, audio, or any combination of these. </p>
<p>Search engines can use:</p>
<p>This isn’t AI or LLMs, they have been using associations and topical understandings for years.</p>
<p>Google’s MUM and BERT are prime examples of machine learning, which non-SEOs or IT professionals would likely consider AI.  </p>
<p>Not every page has to rank or be optimized. Homepages may only need to appear for brand searches. </p>
<p>Instead, prioritize optimizing product, service, blog posts, and category pages. Use the homepage and navigation to pass authority to these pages through text links and menus.</p>
<p>Here are some of the on-page contextual elements you may want to check for both SEO and the user. </p>
<p>Also known as H tags, header tags define the topic of the page and the individual sections underneath. </p>
<p>Clear and specific language improves the user experience for both visitors and search engines, compared to using fluffy words or branding.  </p>
<p>Use the words your customers use in the headers, not branded words or “SEO keywords” as phrases.  </p>
<p>This is more important than ever as modern search engines and AI use entities to make associations and generate answers or search results. It is not a game of keywords and hasn’t been for over 10 years.</p>
<p>If the visitor cannot see images because of visual impairment, they cannot associate the content in the section if the header isn’t specific and you rely on images. It is more crucial if there is no supporting imagery, as now they have to rely on random words. </p>
<p>An example could be “crossing the finish line first” as a header on a page for an SaaS product that speeds up a system.  </p>
<p>If that is the majority of content on the landing page, or the top is fully branded, and you show an image or table with before and after, you just created a bad experience for search engines and users with disabilities.</p>
<p>Instead, say “Speed up XYZ systems 10X faster” and then add your branding. You can cross the finish line ahead of competitors with ABC solutions.  Here’s how customers like you improve their workflows.</p>
<p>There should only be one H1 tag on a page (which includes navigation and menus), and the keywords and topic should pass to H2s.</p>
<p>If the topic and H1 is “t-shirts,” you don’t have to repeat that in your H2s. You can simply do “Blue Crew” and “Red V Neck” as your H2s. And the copy below will take care of the rest.</p>
<p>Header tags must be used in a specific order and should not skip levels. For instance, you shouldn’t go directly from H2 to H4. However, going back up is OK, like moving from H4 to H2.</p>
<p>Avoid using header tags for font size styling or in navigation. </p>
<p>While using them in menus isn’t the worst thing, it’s not the best practice. The same goes for defining sections or lists in your site’s footer.</p>
<p>The one exception to having multiple H1 tags is blogs. Blog titles are normally H1 tags, but with proper coding, you can fix this. </p>
<p>More than one H1 tag on a page is not a good idea unless it is a blog category page with multiple posts, so avoid it when you can. </p>
<p>Title tags appear within a search result and can help entice a user to click through to your page and a search engine to understand the page’s topic. They’re very similar to the title of a book. </p>
<p>The title tag should match the theme of the H1 tag, but they don’t have to be identical.</p>
<p>Title best practices change depending on the tool you use, as the space depends on pixels, not characters. </p>
<p>Most tools give a character count. Because a phrase with multiple letters like “m” or “w” takes more pixels than phrases with more “i” or “t,” some titles can have 55 characters with spaces and others 60.</p>
<p>It is never a good idea to keyword stuff and create excessively long titles.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s local, national, or international SEO. Keyword stuffing is never a good idea and leads to issues across the board.</p>
<p>Instead, test ways to make titles more relevant to the users and use the keyword phrases customers use because this can help entice a click through.  </p>
<p>The title also helps define what the topic of the page you’re going to load is, so it has value for SEO too.</p>
<p>While meta descriptions don’t directly impact rankings, they are crucial for on-page SEO.</p>
<p>If your description is more relevant, you might get clicks over a higher-ranked site with an inadequate description.</p>
<p>Think of content as the fuel for search engines. It includes text, images, sounds, videos, and any other type of media. </p>
<p>Clear and to-the-point content improves the user experience and helps Google know when to display your page for certain queries and to the right audience.</p>
<p>If you bury useful information behind unnecessary words or use fancy branding instead of clear language, Google may struggle to determine your page’s purpose. </p>
<p>Text content, which is the most common, can be formatted in:</p>
<p>Don’t worry about word counts or keyword density for SEO. These are just measures used by tools to assess content and not by search engines like Google or Microsoft Bing.</p>
<p>Provide a strong answer with evidence, support it with facts, and don’t hesitate to link to specific blogs, websites, or studies. Even if a site is new or has a low score in SEO tools, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s unreliable. </p>
<p>For instance, an article might be written by a licensed professional on their new blog, and they could be a recognized expert. Linking to their study is better as it leads to the original source, not a third-party journal.</p>
<p>Metrics like domain authority, authority score, etc., are from third-party tools, not search engines. If a tool suggests not linking to a site, it doesn’t necessarily mean you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>When deciding on your external linking strategy, focus on the quality of the site, content, and author rather than relying solely on tool metrics.</p>
<p>Make sure the citations back up the claim, don’t cite a definition. Definitions can be done after you mention the jargon or with an example.  </p>
<p>Citations should be studies, examples that don’t make sense for your page, and back up the claim with facts and peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>One very important thing, especially with AI answers, is to never leave a statement open.  </p>
<p>Don’t just say something is great, share why it is great and provide supporting details.</p>
<p>We’re redoing a lot of content with clients to fix this issue, and those clients are appearing more often in AI overviews.</p>
<p>For example, when you say “blue is the best,” it should also include “blue is the best because it has XY effect on performance, and the resell value is AB times higher after 5 years than yellow.”  </p>
<p>By sourcing the claims and giving the “how” and “why” on generic statements, you give the visitor and AI a reason to continue reading, indexing, and absorbing your content.  You’re being “helpful.”</p>
<p>These are links from one page on your website to another page. They help search engines understand the topic of each page and help build your site structure.</p>
<p>Internal links include:</p>
<p>A best practice is to map out your internal links to make sure you’re not linking off the same words to multiple pages or into redirect chains (daisy chains).</p>
<p>There is one exception to linking the same phrase to two separate pages. When the phrase is in an informational context, go to a guide or explanation.  </p>
<p>If the phrase is in a shopping context and the user is ready to purchase or fill out a form, go to your shopping or conversion page.</p>
<p>Internal links may also pass authority built from backlinks from one page to another. I personally believe they do hold some weight, but some of my peers say they do not anymore.</p>
<p>Some say the position of internal links in content is crucial, but Google has debunked this myth. The idea is that internal links placed higher up on the page are more important, but I disagree. </p>
<p>Internal links should be natural and placed where they benefit the user. </p>
<p>For example, it might make sense to have a link at the bottom if you’re citing a definition rather than forcing it into the middle of a paragraph.</p>
<p>Some SEOs suggest that you can “sculpt” rank by building more internal links to specific pages. I have seen this work, and I’ve also seen where it doesn’t. </p>
<p>My recommendation is to use internal links naturally to benefit a user on the page – not to sculpt rank.</p>
<p>Another SEO theory is that menu and footer links may have more authority than in-content internal links because they:</p>
<p>This one can make sense and be tested. But it doesn’t always work or move the needle, so use your data and control groups.</p>
<p>A last internal linking myth is that the more links on a page, the less authority they can pass. </p>
<p>I see the merit in the claim, but have not seen an impact in any test I’ve done, so for me, it is just a myth. </p>
<p>Go with what will benefit the end user; don’t use internal links for SEO ranking purposes.</p>
<p>Linking to resources, sources, and other websites is part of SEO; you should not be afraid to do it. Multiple search engine representatives have said it is ok and a best practice when the link is earned.</p>
<p>If the website provides valuable content that supports your article, link to it. </p>
<p>If you are paid to give a link, mark it as sponsored. If you don’t trust the site, but the resource is good and worth linking to, use the nofollow attribute. </p>
<p>Search engines are always looking for unique perspectives and experiences.</p>
<p>If you sell products from other people, like a department store, or you have an affiliate website, look up customer complaints and questions.</p>
<p>You can use forums and reviews to find these. Then, incorporate the accurate answers and definitions into your product descriptions and specs. </p>
<p>This helps the end user decide, showing search engines that your content is more beneficial to an end user than a competing website. </p>
<p>It could be sizing, compatibility, user experience level needed, actual color in real life vs. photos, etc. These are beneficial to consumers and can give you an advantage. </p>
<p>Make sure to name your images for what the image is about and/or the section of the page. </p>
<p>If it is a featured image for display and in your meta, matching the post’s topic could make sense. </p>
<p>If it is a diagram, label what the diagram is and what the person will learn. Have a formula or calculation, name the image for it, and you can add “example” or “infographic” if it is relevant.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed the name, fill out the alt text and description. These can help people using browsing assistants and search engines understand what is in the image better.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>These refer to non-visible elements search engines use to understand your page and page experience. I’m not including items like .htaccess because they’re related to SEO but not essential to the day-to-day tasks of an SEO specialist. </p>
<p>Also, robots.txt and sitemaps, even though they’re crucial for SEO, aren’t considered here because they deal with how search engines explore and find your site, not what’s directly on the webpage.</p>
<p>Clickable elements include buttons, links, calls to action (like phone numbers, emails, icons, logins), and sometimes form submissions should be named for the action. </p>
<p>They can signal to search engines which pages are meant for conversions and, like internal links, the topics of the pages being linked to.</p>
<p>Search engines can also potentially determine if a page experience is a direct conversion or contextual and informative based on the clickable elements and the action being taken.</p>
<p>If the goal of a search engine is to show the most relevant result in the fastest way possible, page speed and site speed make sense. But don’t obsess over them. </p>
<p>Page speed provides a good user experience, but SEO-wise, there are more important things than Core Web Vitals.</p>
<p>In my view, these factors come into play only when everything else is the same, and search engines must choose between two pieces of equally good content.</p>
<p>In such cases, the page that loads faster and becomes interactive sooner should be preferred. However, different people may have different opinions on this, and that’s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>A canonical link is a meta tag that helps deduplicate content for search engines by defining where the official version of the content lives. They are used:</p>
<p>Canonicals are also vital to migrating URLs, as you want to define where the new page exists.</p>
<p>Meta robots are meta tags that tell a search engine if they should index or not index the page, and follow or nofollow the links on the page.</p>
<p>These are different from robots.txt, which defines which folders, pages, URLs, parameters, and backlinks should count and not count.</p>
<p>A temporary landing page, for example, could be noindex, follow because it is not something that should be indexed as it is temporary, but you have internal links and want Googlebot to follow and crawl your website. </p>
<p>The temporary page could be linked to by a journalist in the media if it is a promotion, and that’s how it gets discovered. Make sure to do these correctly, and they’re always situational.</p>
<p>But here’s a rule of thumb if you get stuck:</p>
<p>This is the code way of saying what the page is about and what the user will experience. </p>
<p>You can define just about anything, from the area you offer a service in and what that service is to a piece of art created by a well-known person. </p>
<p>There is schema for:</p>
<p>If you don’t see a library relevant to your page, you can use additional types and build one to help search engines understand what you’re providing to searchers. </p>
<p>Schema warnings can be nerve-wracking, but they’re not an end-all. </p>
<p>Sometimes, a specific recommended field isn’t relevant. However, errors need to be resolved as they can impact your site.</p>
<p>Although some may not be used by all search engines, you can find all available schemas here on Schema.org.</p>
<p>Optimizing just a few of these elements can provide a rankings boost. </p>
<p>However, addressing the on-page SEO basics discussed here will put your pages in the best possible position to rank.</p>
<p>Follow these on-page optimization best practices, and you should see improved organic visibility and more qualified traffic to your site.</p>
