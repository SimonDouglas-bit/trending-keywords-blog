<p>Published on June 16, 2025</p>

<p>In 2024, shifts in how search engines and AI tools surface content forced us to rethink our stance on SEO – from something we ignored to something we needed to master.</p>
<p>For the longest time, we didn’t just avoid SEO – we openly dismissed it. </p>
<p>At our agency, we built our name on performance. </p>
<p>We were PPC purists: results today, data-driven decisions, and growth we could prove by the end of the week. </p>
<p>SEO, by contrast, always felt like a vague, slow-moving machine driven more by gut feel and Google mood swings than repeatable systems. </p>
<p>It wasn’t our space, and frankly, we weren’t interested.</p>
<p>There’s always been an unspoken rivalry between PPC and SEO. </p>
<p>They compete for visibility in the same search results, but they speak completely different languages. </p>
<p>PPC offers instant traction and clarity. SEO offers long-term compounding value – eventually. We didn’t have the talent, we didn’t buy the timelines, and we didn’t see the fit.</p>
<p>But all that started to change in 2024.</p>
<p>The rise of AI-driven search experiences – ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google’s AI Overviews – reshaped how people interact with content. </p>
<p>The rules changed. </p>
<p>Structured data, semantic context, and machine-readable signals became the new gatekeepers of organic visibility. </p>
<p>It wasn’t just about optimizing for Google anymore. It was about optimizing for the language models that now:</p>
<p>And that opened the door.</p>
<p>We realized that SEO was no longer an abstract game of patience. </p>
<p>It was a technical, structured, intent-driven opportunity – the kind of challenge we were built to solve. </p>
<p>So we rolled up our sleeves and built an SEO service grounded in what we knew best: performance.</p>
<p>Before we ever considered offering SEO, we had to confront why we stayed away for so long:</p>
<p>We weren’t going to offer SEO until we could offer it our way.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Why AI will break the traditional SEO agency model</p>
<p>When we finally got serious about building SEO into our agency, we started from scratch. </p>
<p>We didn’t copy other agencies. We translated our PPC process into something that made SEO work the way we needed it to.</p>
<p>Here’s how we made it work.</p>
<p>We didn’t look for someone steeped in link building or legacy content farms. We hired:</p>
<p>We integrated them with our media team – not siloed away in an “SEO department.”</p>
<p>This made collaboration smoother, faster, and more aligned with business outcomes.</p>
<p>We didn’t offer this to every client on Day 1. We handpicked a few ambitious partners who:</p>
<p>These clients became our SEO incubator. </p>
<p>We tested fast, iterated hard, and got results we could show. That gave us the confidence and proof points to scale.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>We focused on things that made an impact quickly and could be measured clearly:</p>
<p>No fluff, no guessing. Just a prioritized roadmap that looked a lot like an ad account optimization plan.</p>
<p>One of the biggest wins we found early on was treating structured data not as a “nice to have,” but as an essential layer of SEO.</p>
<p>This was the bridge between organic visibility and AI-powered results.</p>
<p>We refused to send clients 12-page PDF reports filled with rank tracking and domain metrics.</p>
<p>Instead, our reports show:</p>
<p>If we couldn’t prove it moved something meaningful, we didn’t include it.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to track visibility across AI platforms</p>
<p>This whole move into SEO was driven by what we believe is the biggest shift in organic visibility in a decade.</p>
<p>Search is no longer just ten blue links and some ads. </p>
<p>AI tools are becoming the first touch for many search journeys. </p>
<p>If your content isn’t structured and entity-aware, you’re invisible to the models driving those experiences.</p>
<p>We’re now building:</p>
<p>And we’re packaging all of it in a way that feels familiar to any performance-driven marketer.</p>
<p>If you’re a PPC-led agency, you’re already thinking in terms of impact, ROI, and optimization cycles. Apply that to SEO. </p>
<p>We were late to the game on SEO. But now that the rules are changing, it’s the perfect time to get in.</p>
<p>If you do it right, SEO can be just as performance-driven as PPC – maybe even more so.</p>
