<p>Google's Martin Splitt and Gary Illyes discuss how much technical knowledge SEO professionals need, and why coding isn't always essential.</p>
<p>Google’s Martin Splitt and Gary Illyes recently addressed a common question in search marketing: how technical do SEO professionals need to be?</p>
<p>In a Search Off the Record podcast, they offered guidance on which technical skills are helpful in SEO and discussed the long-standing friction between developers and SEO professionals.</p>
<p>“I think in order to optimize a system or work with a system so deeply like SEOs do, you have to understand some of the characteristics of the system.”</p>
<p>However, he clarified that strong coding skills aren’t a requirement for doing effective SEO work.</p>
<p>Splitt, who regularly speaks at both developer and SEO events, acknowledged that the relationship between these groups can sometimes be difficult.</p>
<p>“Even if you go to a developer event and talk about SEO, it is a strained relationship you’re entering.”</p>
<p>He added that developers often approach SEO conversations with skepticism, even when they come from someone with a developer background.</p>
<p>This disconnect can cause real-world problems.</p>
<p>Illyes shared an example of a large agency that added a calendar plugin across multiple websites, unintentionally generating “100 million URLs.” Google began crawling all of them, creating a major crawl budget issue.</p>
<p>Rather than recommending that SEO professionals learn to code, Splitt advises understanding how web technologies function.</p>
<p>“You should understand what is a header, how does HTTPS conceptually work, what’s the certificate, how does that influence how the connection works.”</p>
<p>He also advised being familiar with the differences between web protocols, such as HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1.</p>
<p>While SEO pros don’t need to write in programming languages like C, C++, or JavaScript, having some awareness of how JavaScript affects page rendering can be helpful.</p>
<p>Google also pointed out that SEO is a broad discipline, and the amount of technical knowledge needed can vary depending on your focus.</p>
<p>Splitt gave the example of international SEO. He initially said these specialists might not need technical expertise, but later clarified that internationalization often includes technical components too.</p>
<p>“SEO is such a broad field. There are people who are amazing at taking content international… they specialize on a much higher layer as in like the content and the structure and language and localization in different markets.”</p>
<p>Still, he emphasized that people working in more technical roles, or in generalist positions, should aim to understand development concepts.</p>
<p>Here’s what the discussion means for SEO professionals:</p>
<p>As websites become more complex and JavaScript frameworks continue to grow, technical literacy will likely become more important.</p>
<p>Google’s message is clear: SEOs don’t need to become developers, but having a working understanding of how websites function can make you far more effective.</p>
<p>For companies, closing the communication gap between development and marketing remains a key area of opportunity.</p>
