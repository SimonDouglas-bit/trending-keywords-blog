<p>We dig into the audit phase of Agentic SEO, showing how AI agents surface, prioritize, and solve SEO problems across your site.</p>
<p>Building on our previous exploration of Agentic SEO’s ideation capabilities, this article takes a closer look at the second pillar: Audit.</p>
<p>As promised, we’ll look at how AI agents can transform the SEO audit process by providing corrections and thorough analysis that would otherwise take hundreds of hours of manual work.</p>
<p>Traditional SEO audits are often time-consuming, involving multiple tools and manual reviews.</p>
<p>With Agentic SEO, however, this process can be streamlined through autonomous AI agents that identify problems and recommend and implement solutions in real time.</p>
<p>Agentic SEO transforms the review process by:</p>
<p>Example: Firecrawl Demo</p>
<p>With advanced AI crawling, Firecrawl can meticulously analyze HTML structures, extract microformats, and provide detailed performance metrics, revealing critical areas that need optimization and might otherwise be missed.</p>
<p>Example:  Similar to tools like Cursor integrated with GitHub, Agentic SEO enables immediate application of code fixes.</p>
<p>When an issue is identified, the agent directly suggests optimized code changes, allowing seamless implementation through direct integration with your repository, ensuring rapid and error-free remediation.</p>
<p>I’m confident that OpenAI’s Codex and Google’s Jules will be equally effective for these tasks.</p>
<p>Similar to our idea workflows, audit workflows consist of specialized components.</p>
<p>The audit workflow typically includes:</p>
<p>AI agents excel at identifying technical issues that are often overlooked:</p>
<p>The agent doesn’t just flag the problem. It provides contextual recommendations and implementation guidance.</p>
<p>Beyond traditional auditing, AI agents can identify content gaps by:</p>
<p>One of the most powerful applications is internal linking analysis:</p>
<p>Creating an effective audit agent requires:</p>
<p>In less than 30 minutes, our Agentic SEO Audit System identified 347 critical technical issues for a mid-sized ecommerce site with 15,000 product pages.</p>
<p>Implementing these recommendations resulted in a 32% increase in organic traffic within 60 days.</p>
<p>Although powerful, Agentic SEO auditing does have its challenges.</p>
<p>Here are some practical tools to help you get started:</p>
<p>To improve your understanding and skills in building SEO audit agents, you can also explore these resources:</p>
<p>Agentic SEO’s audit capabilities represent a fundamental shift in how we approach technical optimization.</p>
<p>By combining AI’s pattern recognition abilities with the strategic insight of human experts, we can create audit systems that are more comprehensive and actionable than traditional approaches.</p>
<p>In our next article, we’ll explore the final pillar of Agentic SEO: Generation. We will examine how AI agents can generate missing content, optimize existing assets, and scale content production while maintaining quality and relevance through the “SEO Expert in the Loop” approach.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, and experiment with these techniques to transform your SEO workflow!</p>
