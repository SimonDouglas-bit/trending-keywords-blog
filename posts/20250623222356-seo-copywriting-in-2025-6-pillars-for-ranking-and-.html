<p>Published on June 23, 2025</p>

<p>There are many reasons why I love the art and science of SEO copywriting. </p>
<p>But the most compelling reason is that it demands a perfect balance between right-brain creativity and left-brain logic. </p>
<p>It’s where imaginative storytelling meets the precision of SEO, in hopes of engaging readers and satisfying the watchful eyes of search engine algorithms.</p>
<p>It’s a tall order, but if you’re able to master the craft of copywriting and then apply the data-driven learnings of SEO, you’ll have a winning combination.</p>
<p>Not just in terms of rankings, but in human connection and trust with your audience.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do that.</p>
<p>You won’t be shocked to hear that SEO copywriting has changed drastically over the past few years. </p>
<p>The marketing world’s hottest topic – artificial intelligence – now dominates conversations around SEO, content creation, graphic design, and nearly every other facet of marketing. </p>
<p>The way we approach SEO research, writing, and reporting has changed.</p>
<p>We have more tools than ever to aid the SEO copywriting process. ChatGPT can conduct keyword research. </p>
<p>Tools like Grok can be used for AI content creation. The AI-powered features provided by tools like Surfer SEO and Semrush make SERP analysis easier and faster. </p>
<p>For its countless applications, AI also has limitations. </p>
<p>One study found that AI chatbots provided incorrect answers to over 60% of queries. </p>
<p>Google AI Overviews have been under fire for giving incorrect and often dangerous advice. </p>
<p>Many AI tools fail to capture the intangible human factors that play a role in real-life decision-making.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for SEO copywriting, exactly?</p>
<p>It means that great SEO copywriting isn’t easily replicated by AI tools (yet). </p>
<p>AI can often speed up the research, formatting, and analysis processes, but the copy doesn’t always hit the mark. </p>
<p>Arguably, AI excels at the logical, left-brain tasks, but struggles with the right-brain magic that brings words to life.</p>
<p>And for compelling SEO copywriting, you need both.</p>
<p>How people consume content has also changed. </p>
<p>Answers to search queries are easily and rapidly answered by Google AI Overviews. </p>
<p>There is less need for users to comb through blog articles and web pages. </p>
<p>Search engines face growing competition from generative AI tools like ChatGPT, reshaping how and where people search for information online.</p>
<p>SEO copywriting used to be solely focused on ranking content in search engines (mainly, Google). </p>
<p>Now, it requires creating content in a landscape where visibility is shrinking and readers seek sources outside the SERPs.</p>
<p>This shift makes the role of the SEO copywriter even more challenging and, even more essential.</p>
<p>Many SEO keyword research tools have taken the thinking out of the content planning process, but that was never their intended purpose. </p>
<p>These tools are designed to validate search volume, competition, etc., not tell you what to target. </p>
<p>Audience insight, context, and relevance must be the primary drivers for deciding which keywords are worth pursuing. This starts with a people-first perspective. </p>
<p>Before opening your keyword tools, get clear on who you’re trying to reach with your content. </p>
<p>The best way to answer these questions is to ask your audience directly through Google Forms surveys and interviews. </p>
<p>The effort to conduct audience research may seem intimidating and time-consuming, but it’s invaluable.</p>
<p>To find out what makes your audience tick, look at:</p>
<p>These are great sources for:</p>
<p>This qualitative data can be used to pinpoint your audience’s motivations and search interests. </p>
<p>Begin your keyword research with clarity, informed by what you know your prospective customers care about. </p>
<p>The resonance of your SEO copy often comes down to common sense. </p>
<p>Put yourself into your target audience’s shoes and think about:</p>
<p>For example, if your company sells ergonomic office chairs, it seems unlikely that your average person would search for “postural correction chair.” </p>
<p>They’re probably searching for: </p>
<p>Further, think about the condition a user might be in when they conduct their search. </p>
<p>Perhaps you sell a pre-made meal subscription, and your target audience is parents looking for quick, easy, and healthy dinner ideas. Their condition might be:</p>
<p>These scenarios might suggest keywords like: </p>
<p>SEO tools won’t always surface these keyword opportunities because they are reliant on the baseline terms you feed into them or your ability to conduct competitor research. </p>
<p>Start your keyword research with a summary of what you already know about your audience. Complement it with what you can learn through:</p>
<p>Dig deeper: The complete guide to optimizing content for SEO (with checklist)</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified some potential topics, layer on the data to ensure your topics are:</p>
<p>This is where tools like Keyword Planner or Semrush come into play, because you can quantify the search volume behind your chosen topics. </p>
<p>You can also determine whether a given topic is too competitive, SEO-wise, for your brand, given the presence of big players in the SERPs. </p>
<p>Use keyword research tools to see how organic searches your prospective keywords receive on a monthly basis. </p>
<p>However, keep in mind that higher search volume isn’t necessarily better; there are a few things to consider:</p>
<p>It’s better to pursue a mid-to-low volume keyword that’s highly relevant to your brand and audience than a high-volume keyword that will attract a more general audience. </p>
<p>You can also use tools like Google Trends, ChatGPT, and even TikTok to spot rising themes before they become saturated. </p>
<p>Being early gives you the chance to create compelling content before the SERPs get crowded.</p>
<p>Note that some of these trends will not be reflected in keyword research tools yet because they are so fresh. </p>
<p>So, to get ahead of the game, watch for seasonal spikes, emerging technologies, news stories, and other shifts in consumer behavior. </p>
<p>Again, if you are going to put time and money into content creation, be sure that content will drive results for your brand. </p>
<p>Whether you’re capitalizing on search volume or capitalizing on trends, make sure the content you create is timely and relevant to your audience.</p>
<p>Now that you’re confident that your content topics are inherently search-worthy and relevant to your audience, create content that’s better than what’s already ranking.</p>
<p>Easy enough, right?</p>
<p>Well, the best place to start is to analyze the SERPs – what publishers are doing well, what’s missing, and the opportunities you see for your content to stand out. </p>
<p>Here’s a quick process to follow:</p>
<p>To elevate your SERP analysis, use AI-driven tools like ChatGPT to:</p>
<p>Users, search engines, and LLMs prefer content that’s well-organized, clear, and informative. </p>
<p>Structuring your content in the right way will help with crawlability and performance. </p>
<p>When it comes to structuring your content, be sure to follow these best practices:</p>
<p>The question to ask yourself when creating any type of content is, “What can I offer that no one else does?”</p>
<p>The answer to this is pretty subjective, but asking this question will help get the creative juices flowing. </p>
<p>It will also make you think more about the reader (their goals and interests) than about pleasing the search engine gods.</p>
<p>The “difference maker” of your content will depend on the type of content you create and the topic at hand, but here are a few ideas:</p>
<p>These ingredients are what most AI-generated content lacks: originality rooted in real-life perspective and examples. Adding personality to your content will help it stand out.</p>

<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Instead of writing at people, write to them. </p>
<p>Think of your content as a one-on-one conversation. Use real examples and relatable scenarios that will appeal to your audience.</p>
<p>Search Engine Land has written extensively about incorporating storytelling into content. </p>
<p>To make your content more relatable, include:</p>
<p>People typically remember how content made them feel, not just what was said. </p>
<p>The better you can tie your topic to your audience’s specific interests, the more likely you are to draw them in with the promise of transformation.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to express a unique point of view, share a story or personal anecdote, or adopt a specific tone of voice for your brand. </p>
<p>The best content isn’t “written for Google” – it’s written with real people in mind – those who will end up buying from you, after all. </p>
<p>A brand that does this really well is Dove with their Real Beauty Stories. </p>
<p>Dove provides its readers with valuable how-tos and tutorials, but these are tied to the experiences of its real customers. </p>
<p>This makes the brand feel more authentic, and the content has a unique edge not easily replicated by other beauty brands.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that optimization is one of the last lessons in this process. </p>
<p>Up until now, you should have focused on creating relevant, interesting, and valuable content. </p>
<p>Achieve that, and optimizing your content becomes much easier. </p>
<p>SEO, in this sense, is more about making your content digestible (by users and search engines). </p>
<p>There are some formatting and tech SEO factors that come into play. </p>
<p>But these shouldn’t necessarily impact the quality or substance of your content. </p>
<p>Once the bulk of your content is written, follow these simple recommendations:</p>
<p>On the tech side, make sure your website is mobile-friendly, loads quickly, and doesn’t have any obtrusive elements (like pop-ups or aggressive ads).</p>
<p>SEO is essentially an art and a science. </p>
<p>Your content needs to be great (art), and your site structure (science) needs to facilitate easy crawling/indexing by search engines. </p>
<p>But one needs to necessarily come before the other – quality content comes first.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: AI optimization: How to optimize your content for AI search and agents</p>
<p>If the substance is there, it mostly becomes a matter of formatting (SEO best practices, site speed, etc.). But SEO “improvements” won’t save terrible writing. </p>
<p>You need to write something worth reading. SEO copywriting in 2025 is all about creative thinking, storytelling, and adaptability. </p>
<p>The search landscape may change quickly – and writers need to adapt – but people are ultimately looking for value, advice, and authenticity. </p>
