<p>“SEO isn’t dead; it’s deprecated.” </p>
<p>These five words from Michael King‘s SMX Advanced presentation on “the end of SEO as we know it” have really stuck with me since I watched his excellent presentation earlier this month.</p>
<p>On the surface, it may seem like business as usual for SEOs. After all, Google sees 5 trillion searches a year. </p>
<p>However, for every 1,000 U.S. Google searches, only 360 clicks go to the open web, according to SparkToro and Datos data.</p>
<p>SEO has been declared dead multiple times, every year, since the early 2000s. It’s been our version of “The Boy Who Cried Wolf” for two decades. But don’t forget: even in that fable, eventually the wolf did come.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other signs that appear to confirm what King said. </p>
<p>Google executives saw the writing on the wall in October, according to an internal memo released as evidence as part of one of Google’s ongoing monopoly trials:</p>
<p>Google is evolving toward AI Overviews. Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai literally told us during this 2024 earnings call, before the opt-in experiment called Search Generative Experience (SGE) was rebranded as AI Overviews and rolled out to users by default. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, AI Mode appears to be the future, whether it becomes the default Google “Search” interface or parts of it are folded into AI Overviews.</p>
<p>The goal since the beginning of Google has been the “Star Trek” computer – where you get an answer, not a list of links. As Google employee number one Craig Silverstein put it in 2008:</p>
<p>Google will look much different before we get to 2033, when conversation will be the interface – not a search box. That’s according to DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman. </p>
<p>Even Google’s mission statement tells you everything you have to know about where Google is going:</p>
<p>There is nothing in there about providing links or sending traffic to websites.</p>
<p>King predicted in his 2023 Search Engine Land article (How Search Generative Experience works and why retrieval-augmented generation is our future) that we’d see fewer clicks and click-through rates plummet. He was right. </p>
<p>Gartner predicted in 2024 that search engine traffic will fall by 25% by 2026. Many SEOs laughed off this prediction. However, some sites have already experienced such a drop – or even a larger one.</p>
<p>Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince isn’t laughing. They’re calling Google and other AI platforms out for behavior they believe will kill the business model of the web. Namely, stealing traffic from publishers.</p>
<p>Clicks are flat or down, yet impressions are going up. It looks like this:</p>
<p>Google’s Martin Splitt explained the great decoupling like this:</p>
<p>In other words: good luck with SEO attribution heading forward.</p>
<p>SEO has been deterministic until now. Certain inputs resulted in fairly predictable outputs. </p>
<p>This new era of information retrieval is probabilistic. We’re in the midst of a slow-moving transition from getting a list of links to webpages to getting synthesized, direct answers, often in the tone and style of a helpful assistant – all heavily influenced by patterns, personalization, and word choice.</p>
<p>Dig deeper. How generative information retrieval is reshaping search</p>
<p>To be clear: SEO isn’t going anywhere. It still matters and will continue to be a thing. (Until it isn’t, whenever that is.) Lily Ray, vice president, SEO strategy and research at Amsive, published a good article (The Rise of AI Search Does Not Mean ‘SEO is Dead’) about this the other day.</p>
<p>I’m not among those talking about rebranding SEO (even though SEO doesn’t have the best reputation and the name “SEO” never really made sense – we don’t optimize a search engine, as Mike Grehan has said many times). </p>
<p>But it’s impossible to ignore this new “thing.” Even if we don’t know what to call it yet. Among the contenders:</p>
<p>Legacy SEO still works – and will continue to work for some amount of time. However, the return on your investment in SEO likely won’t be as great as it was in prior years for many websites. That’s just the reality. </p>
<p>I will never go so far as to say clicks/traffic are vanity metrics. For publishers (like Search Engine Land) traffic continues to matter. Google impressions don’t pay salaries. And I agree with what Cyrus Shepherd, owner of Zyppy SEO consulting, shared recently on LinkedIn:</p>
<p>But the reality is that website traffic has gone down and will continue to. </p>
<p>Google organic search traffic is gone and isn’t coming back.</p>
<p>So keep doing legacy SEO – but evolve.</p>
<p>Because, as Ryan Jones, senior vice president, SEO, at Razorfish, said it on LinkedIn:</p>
<p>Because the future is not about ranking pages – it’s about creating a notable, trustworthy brand that gets cited and mentioned. Wherever, whenever, and however you can. </p>
