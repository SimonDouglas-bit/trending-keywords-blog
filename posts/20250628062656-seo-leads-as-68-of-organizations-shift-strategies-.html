        As Google, OpenAI, and other AI platforms reshape the future of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115026-git-without-a-forge.html">search</a>, marketers seem unsure whether to run, walk, crawl, or just watch it all happen right now. That’s according to findings from a new BrightEdge survey of 750 search, content, and digital marketers.
Why we care. SEO may be leading the AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115026-git-without-a-forge.html">search</a> parade – but without support from content, PR, and leadership, it’s marching without a band. BrightEdge warns that without cross-functional backing, even the most skilled SEO teams risk turning experiments into dead ends as we transition to the era of generative engine optimization (GEO).
SEO leads the way. 68% of organizations are changing their <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115026-git-without-a-forge.html">search</a> strategies right now in response to AI search, according to BrightEdge. And most organizations (54%) are relying on SEO/digital marketing teams to lead AI search initiatives. That’s more than all other departments combined:
However, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115026-git-without-a-forge.html">brightedge</a> warned that this “massive concentration of responsibility” leaves teams without the needed cross-functional support for a winning AI strategy.
AI Overviews. Google’s AI Overviews are creating subtle shifts rather than dramatic disruptions to most organizations, according to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115026-git-without-a-forge.html">brightedge</a>. Meanwhile, most marketers are optimistic, but also unsure about AI Overviews: 
Multi-platform mindset. AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115026-git-without-a-forge.html">search</a> doesn’t mean “Google only,” which is why 45% of those taking action are prioritizing strategies around AI Overviews and ChatGPT (27%) or adding tools like Claude and Perplexity (18%).
What they’re saying. <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115026-git-without-a-forge.html">brightedge</a> advised tracking your brand presence (mentions/citations) across all the generative engines and urged collaboration across teams, before concluding its report with this advice:
