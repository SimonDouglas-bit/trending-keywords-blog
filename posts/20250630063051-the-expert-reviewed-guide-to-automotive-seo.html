<p>This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic.</p>
<p>I became interested in automotive SEO after buying a new car and getting some repairs done on my old one at the same time. I found the dealerships and repair shops that helped me out, as well as the car that I bought, through Google.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t shown up when I was looking, I never would have known they existed. That got me thinking about how crucial search visibility really is for auto businesses.</p>
<p>This article isn’t just my take on automotive SEO. It’s been reviewed, enriched, and inspired by six experts with hands-on experience in this niche. Their insights helped me keep this guide grounded in real-world experience.</p>
<p>The automotive industry covers a lot of ground: dealerships, repair shops, auto parts sellers, manufacturers, and more. While I’ve focused on SEO tactics that apply universally across most automotive businesses, I’ll call out specific strategies where needed. If you’re looking for in-depth guidance tailored to your business type, I’ll point you to more focused resources along the way.</p>
<p>Think of automotive SEO as making sure you show up when people search for cars or auto services online. It’s different from regular SEO because car shopping is… well, it’s pretty unique.</p>
<p>Here’s what makes it special:</p>
<p>Every page you optimize adds to your ability to attract customers. The results work for you 24/7, and build on each other over time. But that’s not all:</p>
<p>Local SEO gets you into Google Maps and those local results that show up before the regular website listings. Even if searchers don’t include location names in their searches, Google might still interpret them as local search intent and prioritize the best results in the nearby area.</p>
<p>Google sees each of your locations as its own separate business, so each one needs to be optimized individually. That means creating a dedicated page for every location, complete with unique content, local reviews, contact details, and photos of that specific spot and team.</p>
<p>Take Christian Brothers Automotive, for example. They have dozens of locations, each with its own optimized landing page and Google Business Profile.</p>
<p>Get listed in automotive directories like Edmunds and Cars.com, as well as general local directories like Yellow Pages and your Chamber of Commerce. Keep your branding and services consistent across these listings.</p>
<p>This has a direct and indirect benefit.</p>
<p>Direct benefit: referral traffic and lead generation. Many of these directories rank highly in search results themselves and are used by shoppers during the research phase. Being featured there can send highly qualified traffic your way.</p>
<p>Indirect benefit: stronger local SEO signals. Google and other search engines rely on data from third-party sites to validate your business’s legitimacy and location (the so-called NAP citations). When your business details are accurate and consistent across multiple reputable sources, it strengthens your local ranking signals, especially in map pack and “near me” searches.</p>
<p>Regular updates to your Google Business Profile (new photos, responding to reviews, posting announcements) show Google and customers that you’re actively managing your business.</p>
<p>When the competition is tough, even small things, like regularly updating your Google Business Profile or responding to reviews, can be what sets you apart and helps customers choose you over others.</p>
<p>If you’re a dealership, don’t miss out on Google’s free Vehicle Listings integration. This feature lets you push your current inventory directly into Google Business Profile, making your cars eligible to show up in local map results, the Shopping tab, and even within the “Cars for Sale” section on Google Search.</p>
<p>It’s one of the few industry-specific perks Google offers, and it’s completely free. Here’s the official guide you need to set this up. </p>
<p>In the automotive world, trust is a dealbreaker. Shoppers want to know they’re dealing with a business that’s honest, responsive, and delivers on its promises. And guess what, Google always looks at online reviews to determine the best local search result (see prominence).</p>
<p>So here’s what you can do:</p>
<p>Keyword targeting connects your website with people who are actively searching for what you offer. It’s how you show up for a buyer typing in “used Honda Civic near me” instead of disappearing behind a wall of irrelevant traffic.</p>
<p>I’m going to walk you through the types of keywords (with examples) you’ll likely need to reach potential customers at every stage of their journey—from early research to purchase and beyond. Each keyword type plays a different role in your overall strategy.</p>
<p>But before we dive in, I want to show you how easily you can find your own keywords.</p>
<p>Start by opening Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer, and ask the built-in AI to suggest keywords relevant to your business.</p>
<p>Then simply use one of the intent filters in the Matching terms report.</p>
<p>Commercial keywords capture people who are comparing options and making decisions. Ranking here helps you position your offerings as the better choice, even if they’re not yet ready to buy.</p>
<p>Transactional keywords are your conversion drivers. These are the high-intent searches from people ready to take action, whether that’s booking a test drive, scheduling a service, or calling your dealership.</p>
<p>Informational keywords attract early-stage searchers. They might not convert right away, but they build trust, brand awareness, and long-term visibility in your niche.</p>
<p>They’re also a smart way to expand your reach beyond your immediate area or build national awareness, since they usually address broader problems that apply everywhere. And because of that wide relevance, they have the potential to drive significant traffic to your site.</p>
<p>Local keywords are essential for showing up in map packs and nearby searches—especially important for dealers, service centers, and repair shops that serve specific geographic areas.</p>
<p>Besides using your keyword research tool, Michelle Tansey also suggested tapping into your team’s insights. Ask your staff what customers are often asking about or what tends to work well in your local area. Their firsthand experience can be a goldmine for content ideas.</p>
<p>To prioritize which keywords to go after, balance these four factors:</p>
<p>To win at automotive SEO, your site needs to support what customers are actually looking for, which depends on your business type. That said, most successful automotive sites tend to focus on these three functional areas:</p>
<p>Each requires its own SEO strategy, and depending on your business model, you’ll emphasize some more than others.</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>These are the digital equivalent of your car lot. They power transactional searches like “used Mazda CX-5 under 20k.”</p>
<p>What to focus on: </p>
<p>This is the part where I got the most tips from the experts. Here are some of my favorites.</p>
<p>Assess your vehicle data sources before scaling. Messy data (e.g., inconsistent naming, missing details) can wreak havoc when you go live. Test first with high-volume makes like Toyota or Ford. </p>
<p>Categorization helps shoppers. Group cars into themes like “family friendly,” “first car,” “under $5k,” “off-road SUVs,” or “luxury SUVs.” These kinds of curated filters make for strong landing pages and better user experience. </p>
<p>If you’re using Google Business Profile (GBP), use the “Products and Services” section to feature brands and models you typically stock. Instead of trying to keep it updated daily, treat it like a curated highlight reel. </p>
<p>Treat brand and model pages as permanent landing pages—even if you don’t have real-time inventory. Include CTAs like “Call us to check availability” or “These sell fast—get in touch now” to make them useful and evergreen. </p>
<p>These bring in high-margin, high-frequency traffic—brake repair, inspections, tire rotation, etc. Most visitors come with a clear intent to act.</p>
<p>Below is an example of repair shops ranking with optimized location pages.</p>
<p>What to focus on:</p>
<p>This is where local SEO and trust-building collide. Done right, these pages help you rank for “Toyota dealer [city]” and convert cold traffic into walk-ins or leads.</p>
<p>Here’s a great example by Sheen group: a landing page listing all locations and a dedicated landing page for each location.</p>
<p>What to focus on:</p>
<p>This part of SEO is about making sure your website works the way it should—fast, easy to load, and simple for both people and Google to navigate.</p>
<p>I always give the same advice here: use a tool like Ahrefs’ Site Audit, fix the problems it finds, and keep it running regularly.</p>
<p>Ahrefs gives you an overall Health Score, showing how many pages on your site have serious issues—these are called errors. If you click on the error count, you’ll see exactly what the problems are, which pages are affected, and get tips on how to fix them.</p>
<p>You don’t need to be a tech expert to handle most of these. Site audit tools will flag the most common issues that hurt your rankings, like:</p>
<p>Once you fix what’s broken, this becomes a simple maintenance task. Site Audit performs regular checks on autopilot. Bigger sites with ecommerce inventory could benefit from an always-on audit that scans 24/7.</p>
<p>By the way, you’ll also get email alerts after each scan, so you don’t really need to remember to open the tool and check.</p>
<p>People head to YouTube when they want to see how something works, what a car looks like, or whether a mechanic knows their stuff. That’s a huge opportunity.</p>
<p>Video builds trust faster than text. A quick walkaround of a car, a before-and-after repair job, or a mechanic explaining a common problem can do more to convince a potential customer than a thousand words ever could.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t have to be fancy. A simple, honest video shot on your phone can work just fine, as long as it’s useful and answers real questions your customers have.</p>
<p>Plus, YouTube is the second biggest search engine in the world. If you’re not showing up there, you’re missing a ton of traffic from people actively researching, comparing, or getting ready to book.</p>
<p>And here’s the kicker: some people find your videos on YouTube, but many find them on Google. Google often pulls YouTube videos directly into its search results (right on the front page). That means a helpful video can give you visibility on two of the biggest search engines at once.</p>
<p>By the way, some AI search engines and LLMS like ChatGPT and Perplexity do the same:</p>
<p>So, here are some ideas for videos you can make:</p>
<p>We’ve got an entire YouTube SEO course right here, so don’t miss it:</p>
<p>Before we wrap this section up, I wanted to show you how to find the aforementioned videos showing up on both Google and YouTube.</p>
<p>Head out to Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer, paste in your seed keywords, and in the Matching terms report, turn on this SERP features filter:</p>
<p>The results will be all keywords where Google shows videos in the SERPs, just like this one:</p>
<p>Finally, here’s a good tip from Michelle: don’t just post to YouTube. Include videos on blog pages or make/model pages to boost engagement and time on page.</p>
<p>Here’s something a lot of dealerships miss: SEO and Google Ads work better together than apart. Instead of seeing them as competing strategies, think of them as complementary approaches that can amplify each other.</p>
<p>Use ads to test keywords before committing to SEO. SEO takes months to show results, but you can test keyword performance with ads in days. If a keyword converts well in paid search, it’s probably worth targeting with SEO content too.</p>
<p>Cover all your bases. Use ads for competitive keywords where you’re not ranking yet, seasonal promotions, and new inventory that needs immediate visibility.</p>
<p>For this, I’d recommend setting up the following filter in Keywords Explorer: bottom of funnel preset, KD from 50 and the cost per click you feel comfortable with as the maximum.</p>
<p>Track these six key metrics to understand your SEO performance:</p>
<p>Keep an eye on competitors, too by monitoring their keyword rankings, tracking their content output, and setting up alerts for new rankings, backlink changes, and web mentions.</p>
<p>You can track all of the above using Ahrefs, and this guide will show you how to set it all up: SEO Tracking For Beginners: All You Need to Know. That includes form completions, custom events, and even funnels, all in the same tool.</p>
<p>And if you work for an agency, you can set up a report that updates on autopilot for each of your clients using Ahrefs’ Report Builder.</p>
<p>My colleague Despina made me realize that ranking on Google is still important, but it’s not the only thing that matters anymore. People want real, honest opinions—from Reddit threads to TikTok videos (don’t miss our new TikTok SEO guide), forum discussions, YouTube reviews, and even AI tools like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>I’ve done it myself. It’s not that Google didn’t have answers—it had too many. So, I turned to ChatGPT and Gemini to help compare car sizes, safety ratings, reliability, warranty nitty gritty details and even wait time for spare parts on imported brands before I made the final decision.</p>
<p>The point is: real buying decisions are happening everywhere, not just on search engines. SEO is still the base, but if you want to stand out, your brand needs to show up wherever people are searching, scrolling, and asking for advice. In other words, your next move is “search everywhere optimization”.</p>
