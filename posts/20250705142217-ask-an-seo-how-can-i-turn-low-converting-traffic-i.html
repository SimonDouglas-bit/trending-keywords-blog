<p>Traffic’s flowing, but sales aren’t? Kevin Gibbons discusses effective strategies for turning more visitors into customers. </p>
<p>This week’s Ask an SEO question comes from an ecommerce site owner who’s experiencing a common frustration:</p>
<p>“Our ecommerce site has decent traffic but poor conversion rates. What data points should we be analyzing first, and what are two to three quick conversion rate optimization (CRO) wins that most companies overlook?”</p>
<p>This is a great question. Having good traffic but poor conversion rates is really frustrating for ecommerce site managers.</p>
<p>You’ve successfully managed to get hundreds or even thousands of people onto your landing pages, but only a tiny proportion of them turn into paying customers.</p>
<p>What’s going wrong, and what can you do about it?</p>
<p>I’ve broken down my tips as follows:</p>
<p>Before answering your question, I think it’s valuable to take a step back and think about your approach to running your site – and what your goals are.</p>
<p>People often get lots of low-quality traffic for the following kinds of reasons:</p>
<p>For me, conversion is always built on the same key fundamentals:</p>
<p>So, before making changes, I’d encourage you to step back and think about your goals and objectives for the site. Everything else will feed into that.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to have a benchmark for what your conversion rate should be.</p>
<p>According to Shopify data, the average ecommerce site conversion rate is 1.4%. A very good rate is 3.2% or above, while very few sites hit more than 5%.</p>
<p>A common reason people get high traffic but low conversions is due to problems with their targeting. Essentially, they’re attracting the wrong kinds of site visitors.</p>
<p>For example, you might run a site selling tennis memorabilia. But most of the traffic you get is from people searching for tickets to tennis tournaments. As a consequence, most visitors bounce.</p>
<p>If this is the case, it’s time to rethink your SEO. Are you ranking for the right keywords? Are your landing pages aligned with the top queries for those search terms? Making changes here can make a big difference.</p>
<p>However, if your targeting is correct but conversion is still off, it’s time to look into CRO.</p>
<p>By analyzing how people navigate your site, you can start to build a picture of how they’re using it – and which features of your site or the user journey are turning visitors off.</p>
<p>If you’re using a store builder like Shopify, Wix, or Squarespace, you should have access to quite a lot of CRO data within the dashboard. On older sites, it can be a bit trickier to figure these things out.</p>
<p>There are lots of metrics that can give you insights into conversion rates. But the following information is often most telling:</p>
<p>This can seem like a lot of work! However, what you’re really looking for is a basic benchmark for each of the above points that you can plug into a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>You only need to gather this data once. Then, it’s just a case of seeing how changes you make affect those scores.</p>
<p>For example, say you have a high cart abandonment rate of 90%. You might decide to make some simple changes to the process (e.g., letting users check out as a guest). You’ll then be able to see what effect your change has had.</p>
<p>This is all about putting yourself in your users’ shoes. I’m often surprised by how few ecommerce site owners do this, yet you can’t understand what’s going wrong if you don’t use the site like a user would.</p>
<p>Simulating user journeys often exposes glaring usability issues.</p>
<p>For example, it’s quite common to land on a category page for, say, sports T-shirts, and find it’s full of broken links. You click on a T-shirt that looks good, but it leads to a 404. That’s such a turn-off to potential customers.</p>
<p>There are, of course, endless possible ways that people can navigate your site. I’d prioritize a handful of your most popular products and try to imagine how people would go through the process of buying them.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things to look out for:</p>
<p>Landing Page (First Impression)</p>
<p>Navigation And Search</p>
<p>Product Detail Pages</p>
<p>Cart And Checkout</p>
<p>Conversion rate optimization doesn’t always require a root-and-branch site upgrade.</p>
<p>Here are some simple tweaks you can make that can be surprisingly impactful.</p>
<p>If a user lands on a product page, it’s crucial to communicate key information to them. Yet, for many products, people have to scroll below the fold to find the information they need.</p>
<p>It can sometimes be surprisingly difficult for people to know how to actually buy things on ecommerce sites, particularly when using mobile. I’d recommend:</p>
<p>Any ecommerce site today should have a search bar where people can look for products. Help people find products by offering auto-suggestions with images and categories.</p>
<p>I’d also recommend tracking no-results queries and fixing them with redirects or better tagging. You might also want to promote high-converting products in the top results.</p>
<p>A poor checkout experience can be a real killer for conversion. The priority here is almost always about making things as easy as possible for buyers.</p>
<p>Exit-intent technology can be very helpful, at least on some kinds of websites.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to use it thoughtfully and appropriately (what makes sense on a fast-fashion website won’t look as good on a luxury goods store).</p>
<p>Instead of broad discounts, use behavioral targeting. Here are some options:</p>
<p>Last but not least, I’d always recommend A/B testing before rolling out whole site changes.</p>
<p>If you’ve tweaked a certain part of the user journey or the layout of a landing page, trial it for a week or so and see what results you get.</p>
<p>This avoids making damaging changes that harm conversion rates (and take a long time to rectify).</p>
<p>I hope these ideas for converting more of your ecommerce site’s visitors have helped.</p>
<p>As I’ve shown, there are tons of potential CRO techniques you can use, and it can get a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>However, it’s often more straightforward than it seems, and you can often start with small steps that make a difference.</p>
<p>One of the reasons ecommerce site management can be so rewarding is the ability to experiment and see how small changes can make a big difference. Good luck!</p>
