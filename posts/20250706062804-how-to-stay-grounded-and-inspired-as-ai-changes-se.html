<p>Published on July 03, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>If you are in or around SEO and have looked on LinkedIn at all in the last two years, you’ve likely witnessed firsthand the wildfire that our industry has become.</p>
<p>LLMs and AI chat tools are cutting into organic traffic in ways we can now see. ChatGPT is eating away at Google’s share. </p>
<p>AI-powered features like Copilot and AI Overviews are claiming clicks that used to be ours. </p>
<p>It’s a seismic shift – and many of us are left wondering if SEO is still worth pursuing. </p>
<p>It’s an honest question. Many people, even the most seasoned SEO pros, are asking it. </p>
<p>Traffic is down in many verticals, sometimes dramatically, and clients are nervous. </p>
<p>It’s not just numbers, it’s people worrying about their jobs, their agencies, their livelihoods. </p>
<p>The search results page itself feels like it’s getting carved up by AI-generated answers, endless ads, and zero-click experiences.</p>
<p>It’s easy to feel like the work we’ve built our careers on is crumbling. </p>
<p>I’ll be real: I’m writing this because half the time I feel like I’m scrambling to keep up. </p>
<p>The FOMO is real – and I know I’m not the only one. And if you’re nodding along right now, good. You’re not alone.</p>
<p>Even with AI experiments everywhere, Google still drives over 60% of all U.S. web traffic referrals, according to SparkToro. </p>
<p>That’s not exactly “dead channel” territory.</p>
<p>Yes, AI Overviews and answer boxes might change how users click. </p>
<p>Some queries might get satisfied on the results page. </p>
<p>But users don’t stop needing in-depth content, products, services, or expertise. They still click through, just more thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Now is not the moment to throw up your hands and quit SEO. </p>
<p>It’s the moment to focus harder on being the site worth visiting, the answer worth citing, and the brand worth trusting.</p>
<p>If your strategy is just “rank for anything and hope for clicks,” yes, you should be worried. </p>
<p>But if your strategy is to actually help people? AI can’t kill that.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: The new SEO imperative: Building your brand</p>
<p>In times like these, the industry does what it always does: it invents new acronyms to sell the fear back as opportunity. </p>
<p>I can’t tell you the number of courses, webinars, and straight-up service offerings flooding my newsfeed, all for a price.</p>
<p>You’ve probably seen some of these galloping across your screen: AI Overviews, GEO, and more.</p>
<p>They’re pitched as magic formulas to make your content “AI-friendly,” guaranteeing your brand will be cited in chatbot answers or appear in some AI-powered search result.</p>
<p>Peter Rota, an SEO I really respect, recently called these “hustlebro acronyms.” </p>
<p>Couldn’t have said it better.</p>
<p>Because that’s what they are – a new coat of paint on old, solid advice.</p>
<p>But here’s the truth: even the best in our industry admit there’s no sure-fire secret playbook.</p>
<p>Wil Reynolds put it so well on a recent LinkedIn post, </p>
<p>If Reynolds is willing to say that out loud, maybe the majority of us should too.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the acronyms making the rounds. Here’s what they really mean, minus the hype.</p>
<p>If you’re doing good SEO now, congratulations – you’re already halfway to “AIO” without even trying.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the good news. The rules haven’t changed as much as the hype suggests.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to understand how AI systems ingest, summarize, and present information. </p>
<p>Yes, we should keep learning. </p>
<p>But the best way to show up in those answers is the same as it’s always been: be the best, clearest, most trustworthy source.</p>
<p>Optimizing for AI is just optimizing for people – because AI models train on our content, and they reward clarity, authority, and usefulness.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to get cited by AI: SEO insights from 8,000 AI citations</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I want to be clear about: AI isn’t just a threat. </p>
<p>It’s also an incredibly useful tool, if you take the time to adapt your processes to include it.</p>
<p>We might not know the “secret” to ranking in AI Overviews, but we know how to use AI to do our jobs better.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways I use AI in my processes:</p>
<p>Is this a comprehensive list? No. </p>
<p>If you’ve spent any time toying around with LLMs, you’ve likely already gotten lost down the rabbit hole of their capabilities. </p>
<p>Everything from automating writing tasks to structured data generation and more. </p>
<p>AI tools have simply made great SEOs faster and broadened their abilities. </p>
<p>Is it magic? No. </p>
<p>You still need to check, edit, and think critically. </p>
<p>But AI can save hours of busywork, help you spot ideas faster, and let you focus on real strategy.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Want to beat AI Overviews? Produce unmistakably human content</p>
<p>Here’s another truth: Many clients are scared right now. </p>
<p>They’re seeing traffic dip, hearing the hype about AI killing search, and worrying about their budgets.</p>
<p>They don’t need someone to sell them the latest acronym. They need someone calm, strategic, and honest.</p>
<p>This is your chance to be that voice:</p>
<p>I know it’s easy to get cynical or burned out. I’ve been there myself. </p>
<p>But here’s what I believe: SEO is not dead. It’s demanding more from us. </p>
<p>The work is still here for people willing to focus on the fundamentals. </p>
<p>The clients are still here for those willing to be calm, strategic advisors instead of selling the next acronym.</p>
<p>And honestly? It’s never been a better time to do meaningful work.</p>
