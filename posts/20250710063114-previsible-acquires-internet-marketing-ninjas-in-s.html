<p>SEO consulting firm Previsible has acquired Internet Marketing Ninjas, a search marketing agency founded in 1999, as part of a move to combine traditional SEO practices with AI-driven strategies. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Previsible, launched in 2021 by former eBay head of SEO Jordan Koene, Tyson Stockton, and David Bell, said the acquisition adds one of the industry’s most experienced link building and digital PR teams to its roster.</p>
<p>Details. The two companies will continue operating as distinct brands.</p>
<p>Why now. Both companies framed the deal as a response to changes in the search landscape – particularly the growing influence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) on how people discover content.</p>
