<p>Published on July 10, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>The content economy is in trouble.</p>
<p>AI crawlers read websites, summarize information, and offer answers without sending users to the original source.</p>
<p>A dramatic drop in traffic from AI models, declining ad revenue, and a growing threat to the business model that has powered the web for decades.</p>
<p>Now, Cloudflare is stepping in with a new approach.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, CEO Matthew Prince said in an interview with Axios:</p>
<p>Last week, Cloudflare introduced a possible solution: Pay Per Crawl, a first-of-its-kind monetization layer that lets publishers charge AI bots (like OpenAI’s GPTBot or Anthropic’s ClaudeBot) for accessing their content.</p>
<p>It’s not a complete redesign of how the web works, but rather a new layer built on top of existing web infrastructure.</p>
<p>The system uses the rarely implemented HTTP 402 “Payment Required” response code to block or charge bots that attempt to crawl a site.</p>
<p>So, how does it work, and what does it mean for the future of generative engine optimization (GEO)?</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<p>It’s worth stepping back for a moment to understand the deeper context behind Cloudflare’s move, as Prince highlighted last week.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years ago, two Stanford grad students started working on a research project called “Backrub.”</p>
<p>That project became Google. But it also became something bigger: the foundation of the web’s business model.</p>
<p>The unspoken deal between Google and content creators was simple:</p>
<p>Google built the entire ecosystem that supports that deal:</p>
<p>For decades, this agreement was what kept the open web alive.</p>
<p>But now, that deal is starting to fall apart.</p>
<p>For the first time, Google’s search market share is declining, and what’s replacing them? </p>
<p>Prince put it plainly:</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Google crawled two pages for every visitor it sent to a publisher.</p>
<p>Six months ago, the ratios were:</p>
<p>The trend is clear: AI reads, learns, and answers, but rarely sends users back.</p>
<p>The mutual value exchange that once powered the web is quietly collapsing, and content creators are being left out of the equation.</p>
<p>When you think about it, the solution is actually pretty smart.</p>
<p>Instead of forcing website owners to choose between two extremes – either block AI crawlers completely or give them full access for free, Cloudflare introduces a third option: charge them.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works.</p>
<p>Within the Cloudflare dashboard, site owners will be able to set one of three access rules for each individual AI crawler:</p>
<p>It’s like introducing an API between content and generative models, where information isn’t just free-floating knowledge; it’s now a monetizable digital asset.</p>
<p>And let’s be clear: this isn’t some garage-stage startup trying to shake up the web.</p>
<p>Cloudflare powers the CDN infrastructure for over 20% of all websites, including media companies, content platforms, governments, and major brands, according to company data, .</p>
<p>Sites like Reddit, Medium, Shopify, Udemy, and The Guardian all run through Cloudflare’s network.</p>
<p>That means one simple thing: if Cloudflare decides to limit access, it can do so at a massive scale.</p>
<p>But scale is only part of the picture.</p>
<p>Cloudflare also knows exactly which bots are visiting these sites and how often.</p>
<p>Cloudflare notes that many publishers aren’t even aware that AI crawlers are visiting their sites so aggressively. The scale of this hidden scraping is likely far larger than most realize.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>First, let’s be clear: Cloudflare will not block BingBot, Googlebot, or any traditional search engine crawlers by default.</p>
<p>However, it does block AI crawlers like GPTBot or ClaudeBot by default, particularly for new websites joining the platform. </p>
<p>Site owners can override this setting and decide which bots to allow, block, or charge using Cloudflare’s new access rules.</p>
<p>The update focuses specifically on AI models, crawlers from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic that gather content to train or power large language models (LLMs), rather than to serve real-time search results.</p>
<p>That said, for the first time, Cloudflare is also giving publishers the option to block or charge traditional search engine crawlers, a level of control that simply didn’t exist before.</p>
<p>Will publishers actually do that?</p>
<p>Probably not, at least not most of them. </p>
<p>Blocking Google or Bing still means risking a huge slice of valuable organic traffic, and for many, that’s too high a price.</p>
<p>And while The Wall Street Journal recently reported a noticeable drop in publisher traffic due to AI-driven search experiences, Google is still responsible for a significant share of most publishers’ traffic today, often 30-60% or more, depending on the site.</p>
<p>But that’s starting to change.</p>
<p>A growing number of major publishers have joined Cloudflare’s Pay Per Crawl initiative, including:</p>
<p>This publication, which first reported the story, is among them.</p>
<p>So while SEO is still too important for most to walk away from, for the first time, the power to say “no,” or at least “pay up,” is officially on the table.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: 3 reasons not to block GPTBot from crawling your site</p>
<p>Absolutely, and more deeply than you might think.</p>
<p>To understand why, let’s use ChatGPT as an example. As many know, the premium version of ChatGPT performs real-time searches using Bing.</p>
<p>But behind the scenes, there are actually two separate processes at work:</p>
<p>Model training (Training data)</p>
<p>Real-time information retrieval</p>
<p>At first glance, you might think, “If my site isn’t blocking Bing, ChatGPT will still see it when users search, so what’s the big deal?”</p>
<p>But here’s the key distinction:</p>
<p>And that’s where Pay Per Crawl starts to matter. </p>
<p>As more websites restrict access to AI crawlers, the training process becomes limited, and that creates three major effects.</p>
<p>Real-time search may still function, but without a strong foundation, the model won’t know what to look for, how to interpret it, or why your content matters.</p>
<p>GEO isn’t just about visibility; it’s about whether the model knows you, trusts you, and understands you. And all of that starts with training.</p>
