        Google's John Mueller discusses whether AI will replace the need for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">seo</a> and explains why websites remain essential.
Google’s John Mueller and Martin Splitt discussed the question of whether AI will replace the need for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">seo</a>. Mueller expressed a common-sense opinion about the reality of the web ecosystem and AI chatbots as they exist today.
The context of the discussion was about <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">seo</a> basics that a business needs to know. Mueller then mentioned that businesses might want to consider hiring an SEO who can help navigate the site through its SEO journey.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">mueller</a> observed:
“…you also need someone like an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">seo</a> as a partner to give you updates along the way and say, ‘Okay, we did all of these things,’ and they can list them out and tell you exactly what they did, ‘These things are going to take a while, and I can show you when Google crawls, we can follow along to see like what is happening there.'”
It was at this point that Martin Splitt asked if generative AI will make having to learn <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">seo</a> obsolete or whether entering a prompt will give all the answers a business person needs to know. Mueller’s answer was tethered to how things are right now and avoided speculating about how things will change in a year or more.
“Okay, I think that’s pretty good. Last but not least, with generative AI and chatbot AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">things</a> happening. Do you think there’s still a value in learning these kind of things? Or can I just enter a prompt and it’ll figure things out for me?”
Mueller affirmed that knowing <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">seo</a> will still be needed as long as there are websites because search engines and chat bots need the information that exists on websites. He offered examples of local businesses and ecommerce sites that still need to be found, regardless of whether that’s through an AI chatbot or search.
“Absolutely value in learning these <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">things</a> and in making a good website. I think there are lots of things that all of these chatbots and other ways to get information, they don’t replace a website, especially for local search and ecommerce.
<p>So, especially if you’re a local business, maybe it’s fine if a chatbot mentions your business name and tells people how to get there. Maybe that’s perfectly fine, but oftentimes, they do that based on web content that they found.</p>
Having a website is the basis for being visible in all of these systems, and for a lot of other <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">things</a> where you offer a service or something, some other kind of functionality on a website where you have products to sell, where you have subscriptions or anything, a chat response can’t replace that.
If you want a t shirt, you don’t want a description of how to make your own t-shirt. You want a link to a store where it’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">like</a>, ‘Oh, here’s t-shirt designs,’ maybe t-shirt designs in that specific style that you like, but you go to this website and buy those t-shirts there.”
Martin acknowledged the common sense of that answer and they joked around a bit about <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">mueller</a> hoping that an AI will be able to do his job once he retires.
<p>That’s the context for this part of their conversation:</p>
<p>“Okay. That’s very fair. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so you think AI is not going to take it all away from us?”</p>
And <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">mueller</a> answers with the comment about AI replacing him after he retires:
“Well, we’ll see. I can’t make any promises. I think, at some point, I would like to retire, and then maybe AI takes over my work then. But, like, there’s lots of stuff to be done until then. There are lots of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">things</a> that I imagine AI is not going to just replace.”
<p>Something that wasn’t discussed is the trend of AI within content management systems. Many web hosts and WordPress plugins are already integrating AI into the workflow of creating and optimizing websites. Wix has already integrated AI into their workflow and it won’t be much longer until AI makes a stronger presence within WordPress, which is what the new WordPress AI team is working on.</p>
Will AI ever replace the need for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">seo</a>? Many easy things that can be scaled are already automated. However, many of the best ideas for marketing and communicating with humans are still best handled by humans, not AI. The nature of generative AI, which is to generate the most likely answer or series of words in a sentence, precludes it from ever having an original idea. AI is so locked into being average that if you ask it to pick a number between one and fifty, it will choose the number 27 because the AI training binds it to picking the likeliest number, even when instructed to randomize the choice.
