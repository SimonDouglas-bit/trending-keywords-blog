Conferences are a great excuse to hang out with other <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a> marketers, talk shop, learn some new tricks, and learn how to do less work today with generative AI.
Without further ado, here are the biggest and best <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a> marketing conferences happening throughout the rest of¬†2025.
<p>Dates: August 24-26Location: Cleveland, USASpeakers: EJ White, Chanel Basilio, Darrell VesterfeltPrices: from US$795Website: https://cex.events/</p>
Think of CEX as the ‚Äúbuild-and-monetize-your-audience‚Äù bootcamp. Founded by Joe Pulizzi (the guy who literally wrote the book on <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a> marketing), the show is laser-focused on turning writers, podcasters, and video creators into full-blown business owners.
<p>Expect success-story keynotes, brutally honest revenue breakdowns, and tactical breakouts on newsletters, community, and productized services.</p>
<p>Notable sessions include:</p>
<p>Dates: September 3-5Location: San Francisco, USASpeakers: Amy Poehler, Marques Brownlee, Dario Amodei, Dharmesh ShahPrices: from US$799Website: https://www.inbound.com/</p>
Hosted by <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a> marketing OG HubSpot, INBOUND offers hundreds of talks, deep dives, fireside chats, and meetups on topics ranging from brand strategy to¬†AI.
<p>Here‚Äôs the recap¬†video:</p>
You can even watch their previous years‚Äô <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">talks</a> on their INBOUND YouTube channel. For example, here‚Äôs HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah‚Äôs talk from INBOUND 2024:
<p>Dates:¬†October 14-15Location: San Diego, USASpeakers: Carrie Rose, Madhav Bhandari, Mark Schaefer, Tim Soulo, Patrick Stox, Ryan LawPrices: from US$799Website: https://ahrefsevolve.com/</p>
2024 was the launch of our first ever fully-fledged SEO and digital <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">marketing</a> conference: Ahrefs Evolve. (Read about how we planned and organized the entire conference here.)
<p>Check out a recap of how 2024‚Äôs Ahrefs Evolve went:</p>
This year, we‚Äôve decided to move our conference to the U.S! This time round, it won‚Äôt just be an SEO conference; we‚Äôre going bigger and beyond and getting the best <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">marketing</a> minds to come down for a great two days of tactical talks, panel discussions, and¬†more.
<p>If you opt for a VIP ticket, you‚Äôll even get a private yacht networking event with the Ahrefs team and all the invited speakers. Pretty cool,¬†huh?</p>
Dates: September 15-17Location: San Diego, USASpeakers: Guy Raz, Ann Handley, Wil Reynolds, Melanie DezielPrices: from US$899Website: https://www.<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a>marketingworld.com/
Arguably the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a> marketing conference, Content Marketing World has been pumping out content talks and inspiration for fifteen years¬†solid.
<p>Here‚Äôs last year‚Äôs recap:</p>
Some notable <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">talks</a> from the upcoming CM World 2025 include:
Dates: October 2-3Location: Manchester, UKSpeakers:Andi Jarvis, Rebecca Rowntree, Lucinda Everett, Azeem AhmadPrices:from ¬£625.10Website: https://www.copywriting<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">conference</a>.com/
<p>What used to be a single day event in London has expanded to a 2-day event in Manchester, UK, hosted by ProCopywriters (a membership community for copywriters.)</p>
Intended for copywriters, creatives, and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a> strategists, the agenda focuses heavily on the qualitative aspects of content that often go overlooked‚Äîcreative processes, tone of voice, and creating emotional connections through copy.
This year‚Äôs <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">talks</a> include sessions like:
<p>Dates: October 5-8Location: Atlanta, USASpeakers:Caroline Roth, Lucie Hyde, Britt Stewart, Nicole LeBlancPrices: from US$2,150Website: https://lavacon.org/</p>
LavaCon is a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a> conference with a very technical focus, with over 70 sessions dedicated to helping companies solve ‚Äúcontent-related business problems, increase revenue, and decrease production costs‚Äù.
<p>In practice, that means speakers from Netflix, Lockheed Martin, Cisco, Salesforce, and JPMorgan Chase, and topics like:</p>
I‚Äôve focused this list solely on in-person, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">content</a>-specific conferences, but there are a ton of content-adjacent (and even online events) happening throughout the year. For example, MarketingProfs‚Äô B2B Forum will be held in Boston, USA from November 17-19.
