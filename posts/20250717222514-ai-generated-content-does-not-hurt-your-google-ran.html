If you think about it, there is no clearer signal than the fact that Google has rapidly rolled out AI Overviews (and now AI mode), both of which are basically AI-generated <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>.
Yet there are still many SEOs and digital marketers who think that Google seeks to actively punish AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>.
We decided to find out the real answer by looking at 600,000 webpages to understand if Google punishes, rewards, or is simply indifferent to AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>.
<p>Here’s what we found:</p>
We took 100,000 random keywords from Ahrefs Keywords Explorer and extracted the top 20 ranking URLs. We then extracted the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> from these URLs, of which we had 600K in our database.
We ran each article through our own AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> detector, which is part of Page Inspect in Site Explorer.
Here’s what our AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> detector found:
<p>Of the ones that were a mix of both human and AI:</p>
You can learn more about how AI detectors work, and why they’re <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>ful, in these articles:
According to our AI detector, Human-written <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> only made up 13.5% of the top 20 ranking pages. This means 86.5% of top-ranking pages contain some amount of AI-generated content.
That is to be expected because AI has more use than just simply generating <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>. You can use it to spell check, improve your grammar, refine your writing, optimize your titles, challenge your ideas, and more. Heck, even this Google Doc I’m writing in has built-in AI.
So, if Google wanted to actively penalize AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>, you wouldn’t expect these kinds of results. If you think about it, the fact that there is pure AI content (even though rare, only 4.6%) in the top-ranking pages already suggests that Google doesn’t punish AI content.
We can kind of expect this to be honest. In our State of AI in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> Marketing report, where we surveyed 879 marketers, 87% of respondents use AI to help create content.
Just as there’s no longer any manufactured steel untouched by nuclear fallout, soon there won’t be any piece of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> that isn’t ‘tainted’, or assisted, by AI.
We calculated the correlation between AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> percentage and search ranking position across our entire dataset. The correlation was 0.011, effectively zero.
<p>In case this is your first time seeing a box plot, here’s how you should read them:</p>
There is no clear relationship between how much AI-generated <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> a page has and how highly it ranks on Google. This suggests that Google neither significantly rewards nor penalizes pages just because they use AI.
If you’re looking for a silver lining somewhere, you’d be happy to know that the very highest-ranking pages, i.e. #1, tend to have slightly less AI-generated <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>.
In fact, if we group them into three groups of minimal AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> (0-30%), some AI use (30-70%), and substantial AI use (70-100%), you’d also be happy to know that the group with minimal AI use correlates very slightly with higher rankings.
This suggests a minor preference for more human-created or lightly AI-assisted <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> at the very top of the SERPs. But bear in mind that the correlation is very weak.
From our research, it seems that Google neither actively punishes nor rewards AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>. So, you don’t have to be afraid and avoid AI content at all costs.
Ultimately, Google probably doesn’t care how you made the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a>. It simply cares whether searchers find it helpful.
If you can make pure AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> that’s unique, helpful, and searchers will want to consume, then I don’t see why not.
But from my experience, and from the data, we can see that it’s difficult to make truly high-quality <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> from AI alone.
That’s likely why most <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">content</a> creators are leveraging AI as a tool to assist in making content, rather than simply generating them.
