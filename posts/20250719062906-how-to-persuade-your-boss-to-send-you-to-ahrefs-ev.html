After hosting 500 marketers and 18 top speakers in the heart of tropical Singapore, we’re bringing our flagship <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">marketing</a> conference stateside this October. Hello, San Diego!
<p>And there’s only one teeny-tiny little thing standing between you and two days of world-class talks and networking: your boss (and their Q4 budget ).</p>
So here are five reasons your boss should send you to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> Evolve (with a handy email you can send them).
<p>Join us and let the magic happen. Learn more and buy tickets.</p>
Don’t get me wrong—you’re already a great marketer. But in a world of ChatGPT and AI Overviews, digital PR and influencer partnerships, great <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">marketing</a> is becoming more and more multidisciplinary.
<p>So we’ve built a world-class roster of multidisciplinary marketers for you to learn from. These are not your average SEO folks.</p>
You’ll see talks from multi-million dollar agency founders, marketing leaders from enterprise brands like IBM and ClickUp, experienced growth consultants to brands like Front, Mercury, hims&amp;hers and Reddit… and a few familiar faces from <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a>.
Confirmed speakers for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> Evolve. More announcements coming soon.
<p>And you can attend sessions like…</p>
<p>See speakers and agenda.</p>
Networking is half the value of in-person events. You can meet your industry peers, your customers (and future customers), and maybe even a few of your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">marketing</a> heroes.
At <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> Evolve, you can hang out with 600+ like-minded marketing pros. We’ve organised dedicated spaces to meet and connect, with networking opportunities scheduled throughout the day. You can enoy a catered lunch, and there’s the evening afterparty with music, drinks, and good company.
My favorite photo from last year’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> Evolve afterparty. Bonus points if you can name everyone.
Meeting people in real life is a career cheat code. I’m pretty introverted, but at last year’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">evolve</a>, I managed to…
<p>So who knows what serendipitous connections you’ll make?</p>
(And for all-access ticket holders… there’s also the private yacht networking. It’s an exclusive sunset cruise where you can meet the speakers, hang out with <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> crew, and socialize with founders and executives from world-class brands.)
If you’re an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> customer (thank you!), you’ll learn tons of tips, tricks and workflow improvements from attending Evolve. You’ll have opportunities to:
Here’s a small snapshot of the limited edition swag we gave out during last year’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">evolve</a>:
Aside from the very interesting topics, what makes this <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">conference</a> even cooler are the ton of awesome freebies
Kudos for making all of these happen for #<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a>Evolve @ahrefs team pic.twitter.com/DGzk5FSTN8

This is one of the best swag bags I’ve received at any conference! Either @<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> actually cares or the other conference swag bags aren’t up to par w Ahrefs!#AhrefsEvolve pic.twitter.com/Yc9e6wZPHn

<p>Hey, “having fun” isn’t your traditional business expense, but it really matters.</p>
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">conference</a>s are an opportunity to break from routine, meet other folks facing the same professional challenges, and come back to work with a head full of new ideas. That’s good for you, and good for your company.
Check out the recap video from last year’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">evolve</a> conference to get excited:
<p>You can save money with our early bird tickets until July 31st, and get up to 15% off tickets if you bring a few colleagues along for the ride.</p>
<p>There’s a lot included in the ticket price too:</p>
And remember: if you can improve your company’s marketing and SEO performance after attending <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> Evolve (and we think you will), you’ll very easily see a positive return on the investment.
<p>Get your tickets now.</p>
If you’re nervous about pitching your boss on attending <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">evolve</a>, remember: the worst that can happen is a polite “not this time”, and you’ll find yourself in the same position you are now.
<p>So here goes: copy this email template, tweak it to your liking, and send it to your boss over email or Slack… and I’ll see you in San Diego 😉</p>
Request to Attend <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> Evolve 2025 – San Diego, CA  Hi [Manager’s Name],
I’d like to request approval to attend <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115124-hytradboi-2025-conference-postmortem.html">ahrefs</a> Evolve 2025, happening October 14–15 in San Diego, with a pre-conference VIP experience on October 13.  This is Ahrefs’ flagship event and its first US edition. It’s designed for marketing professionals, agency leaders, and decision-makers looking to sharpen their edge in marketing, SEO, content strategy, AI, and data-driven performance.  I believe attending will bring immediate value to our team—especially for [mention specific project or initiative].  Why it’s worth attending:  1. Strategic insights, not fluff. The agenda includes practical sessions from top CMOs, SEO leaders, and performance marketers. Topics include: - How AI is changing search and marketing - Content strategies that drive revenue, not just rankings - Technical SEO, CRO, and performance analytics - Emerging tools and frameworks we can implement right away  2. Valuable connections. Evolve brings together 600+ attendees from leading brands and agencies. The networking opportunities could lead to idea exchanges, partnerships, and new perspectives that benefit our work.  3. Real impact back at work. I’ll document key learnings and share takeaways with the team through internal notes, recaps, or a short workshop. The goal is to ensure this investment translates into smarter strategies and improved outcomes.  Let me know if we can set aside a few minutes to discuss. I’m confident this will be a worthwhile opportunity to elevate our work.  Thanks, [Your Name]
