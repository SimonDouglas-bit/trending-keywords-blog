<p>Published on July 21, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Organic traffic is down, AI Overviews are stealing your clicks, and your boss is questioning every dollar spent on SEO. </p>
<p>The temptation to slash that budget is real, especially when you’re watching competitors get featured in AI-generated summaries while your optimized pages sit invisible below the fold.</p>
<p>Cutting SEO now would be shortsighted. The smart move isn’t retreat – it’s evolve. </p>
<p>People haven’t stopped searching. They’re searching more, just differently.</p>
<p>The companies thriving in 2025 aren’t spending less on SEO. They’re spending differently. </p>
<p>While your competitors panic and pull back, you have a golden opportunity to dominate the AI-driven search landscape. </p>
<p>The question isn’t whether to invest in SEO, it’s how to invest smarter.</p>
<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room with some hard numbers:</p>
<p>These numbers feel scary if you’re still thinking about SEO the old way.</p>
<p>But here’s what the doom-and-gloom crowd is missing: 82.5% of marketers increased their SEO budgets in 2024. </p>
<p>That’s not the behavior of a dying industry, but adaptation in action. </p>
<p>These marketers understand something crucial: the game has changed, but it hasn’t ended.</p>
<p>The traffic isn’t disappearing, it’s changing form. </p>
<p>When your content gets cited in AI Overviews, you’re building authority that extends far beyond traditional rankings. </p>
<p>You’re becoming the trusted source that AI systems reference, which builds brand credibility in ways old-school SEO never could. </p>
<p>When someone sees your brand mentioned as the authoritative source in an AI-generated answer, that carries more weight than simply appearing as link number three in organic results.</p>
<p>This shift represents the biggest opportunity in search since Google’s early days.</p>
<p>While most companies are paralyzed by uncertainty, forward-thinking marketers are capturing market share by understanding how AI systems evaluate and cite content. </p>
<p>The brands that master this transition will not only survive but also dominate their industries.</p>
<p>Despite the clear evidence that AI-optimized SEO strategies work, many marketing teams are still making budget decisions based on outdated assumptions. </p>
<p>These misconceptions aren’t just wrong, they’re actively harmful to your competitive position.</p>
<p>This is the most dangerous myth circulating in marketing circles right now. </p>
<p>AI Overviews don’t replace organic results, they cite sources. </p>
<p>Being referenced in these summaries often brings more credibility than ranking in Position 1 organically ever could. </p>
<p>Someone seeing your brand mentioned in an AI answer three times in one week is not lost traffic; that’s brand recognition at scale.</p>
<p>Consider what happens when a potential customer asks ChatGPT about the best CRM software for small businesses. </p>
<p>If your product gets mentioned as the recommended solution, with specific reasons why it’s ideal for that use case, you’ve just bypassed the entire “search, evaluate, and compare” process. </p>
<p>That prospect is arriving at your website already pre-qualified and ready to engage.</p>
<p>The key insight here is that AI systems need authoritative sources to build their responses. </p>
<p>By optimizing for AI citations, you’re essentially competing to become the trusted advisor in your industry, which is far more valuable than any single ranking position.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: AI search is booming, but SEO is still not dead</p>
<p>This outdated thinking is costing companies millions in missed opportunities. </p>
<p>The modern search experience now includes multiple visibility opportunities:</p>
<p>You might rank in Position 3 for “marketing automation software,” but if an AI Overview appears above your listing and mentions your competitor while ignoring you, your actual visibility plummets to near zero.</p>
<p>Smart marketers are now tracking “share of voice” across all SERP features, not just blue link rankings. </p>
<p>Instead of celebrating a move from Position 8 to Position 5, focus on increasing your overall visibility footprint across these diverse search features.</p>
<p>This fear is driving some companies to abandon content creation altogether, which is exactly the wrong response. </p>
<p>AI-generated content at scale creates massive duplication problems and introduces hallucination risks that can damage your brand reputation. </p>
<p>When every company in your industry uses similar AI prompts, you end up with eerily similar content that provides no competitive differentiation.</p>
<p>More importantly, AI systems are specifically designed to identify and prioritize content that demonstrates genuine expertise, authority, and trustworthiness. </p>
<p>Your unique perspective, customer insights, and brand voice can’t be replicated by AI tools. </p>
<p>The companies winning in this environment are those using AI to enhance their content creation process while maintaining human oversight and expertise at every level.</p>
<p>Consider the difference between an AI-generated article about “email marketing best practices” and a piece titled “How we increased our email open rates by 47%: Data from 10,000 campaigns.” </p>
<p>The second one demonstrates real expertise backed by proprietary data that only your company can provide. </p>
<p>This is the type of content that AI systems love to cite because it represents genuine authority rather than regurgitated information.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>The most successful companies aren’t cutting their SEO investments.</p>
<p>They’re strategically reallocating resources to areas that deliver results in our new AI search landscape. </p>
<p>This isn’t about spending more money; it’s about spending the same budget more intelligently.</p>
<p>Your content budget needs a complete transformation. </p>
<p>Instead of generic blog posts, invest in content that demonstrates genuine expertise:</p>
<p>Three content types that AI systems love to cite: </p>
<p>When you publish findings like “How we increased email open rates by 47%: Data from 10,000 campaigns,” you’re providing information that no competitor can replicate. </p>
<p>AI systems gravitate toward this type of unique, data-backed content because it represents genuine value rather than rehashed information.</p>
<p>The key is moving beyond content creation to content amplification. Build relationships with: </p>
<p>The goal isn’t direct traffic anymore; it’s earning mentions and becoming the source that others reference when they write about your industry.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Want to beat AI Overviews? Produce unmistakably human content</p>
<p>While everyone obsesses over AI content strategies, the smartest marketers are doubling down on technical SEO. </p>
<p>If AI systems can’t easily understand and parse your content, it doesn’t matter how great your content is.</p>
<p>But modern AI optimization goes deeper than traditional technical SEO. </p>
<p>AI systems don’t just evaluate entire pages; they break your content into digestible chunks that can be retrieved and cited independently. </p>
<p>Your content architecture should support this by organizing information into logical, self-contained sections that can stand alone when referenced.</p>
<p>The technical priorities for AI optimization include:</p>
<p>Brand searches represent the new gold standard for SEO success, and for good reason. </p>
<p>When someone searches “your company name + demo,” they’re already 80% of the way to becoming a customer. </p>
<p>These high-intent queries convert at rates that make traditional keyword targeting look inefficient by comparison.</p>
<p>The strategy here involves creating content specifically designed to capture brand-related searches. </p>
<p>This content serves multiple purposes: </p>
<p>AI doesn’t cite by accident. You need a strategy. </p>
<p>Create content in formats that AI systems prefer: </p>
<p>Answer questions directly and provide data that AI can easily extract and reference in their responses.</p>
<p>Building relationships with high-authority sites in your industry remains crucial, but the goal has evolved. </p>
<p>When respected publications cite your research or quote your executives, those mentions become part of AI’s “trusted dataset” for your industry. </p>
<p>It’s like getting a letter of recommendation from the most respected voices in your field, which carries enormous weight when AI systems evaluate source credibility.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to get cited by AI: SEO insights from 8,000 AI citations</p>
<p>Traditional ranking reports won’t cut it in budget meetings anymore. </p>
<p>Your executives want to see real business impact. The metrics that matter now are those that: </p>
<p>Branded search volume tells you everything about your brand’s health in the market. </p>
<p>When people start searching for your company name, product names, or even your CEO’s name, you’re witnessing the direct result of successful authority building. </p>
<p>These searches typically convert higher than generic keyword searches because they represent qualified prospects who already know and trust your brand.</p>
<p>Track both the volume and variety of branded queries. Look for increases in searches like: </p>
<p>These queries indicate that your brand awareness campaigns are working and that people are actively considering your solution.</p>
<p>The beauty of branded search growth is that it represents organic demand generation. </p>
<p>People don’t search your brand just because of ads. </p>
<p>They search because they’ve seen it show up in:</p>
<p>This type of demand is both more valuable and more sustainable than traffic generated through paid advertising.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to track visibility across AI platforms</p>
<p>Here’s where measurement gets interesting.</p>
<p>AI-generated summaries now appear in 47.5% of search results, and your brand’s presence in those overviews often matters more than where you rank. </p>
<p>This metric tracks how often you’re cited as an authoritative source compared to competitors across AI-powered search.</p>
<p>While measurement tools are still catching up to this reality, you can manually track your presence in AI Overviews for your most important keywords. </p>
<p>Look for patterns in how AI systems describe your company, which features they highlight, and how you’re positioned relative to competitors. </p>
<p>This qualitative analysis reveals opportunities to optimize your content for better AI citations.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t just to be mentioned, it’s to be positioned as the authoritative source that AI systems trust and cite most frequently. </p>
<p>Companies that achieve this level of recognition often see improved performance across all their digital marketing channels, as AI citations build credibility that extends far beyond search results.</p>
<p>Most SEO teams struggle with this, but it’s absolutely critical for budget justification and securing leadership buy-in. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, tracking every touchpoint in today’s customer journey is getting harder, as people: </p>
<p>The old-school approach of assigning credit to every interaction has become nearly impossible. </p>
<p>Privacy changes, ad blockers, and the reality that people use multiple devices have broken traditional attribution models. </p>
<p>You need to get smarter about SEO measurement.</p>
<p>The most effective approach combines detailed tracking with broader impact measurement. </p>
<p>Yes, you should still track assisted conversions when you can capture them. </p>
<p>Someone might discover your brand through organic search, return later via direct traffic, and convert through email marketing. </p>
<p>Use Google Analytics 4’s multi-touch attribution to capture these journeys when the data is available.</p>
<p>But equally important is measuring the overall business impact during periods of SEO investment. </p>
<p>Instead of trying to attribute every sale to specific touchpoints, examine whether your key business metrics improve when you actively invest in content and optimization. </p>
<p>Essential metrics for proving SEO impact:</p>
<p>Create reports that show both the trackable connections and the bigger picture trends. </p>
<p>That industry research report might generate 200 qualified leads that you can directly track. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, your consistent expert content publishing over six months correlates with a 30% increase in branded searches and a 25% boost in sales-qualified leads.</p>
<p>The key is acknowledging measurement limitations while still building a compelling business case. </p>
<p>Modern customer journeys are messy, but the companies investing in authority-building content and technical optimization are seeing real business growth. </p>
<p>Your job is to capture enough of that story to keep the budget flowing.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: SEO KPIs to track and measure success in the age of AI</p>
<p>Your competitors are panicking over declining click-through rates. That’s your opening.</p>
<p>The brands that adapt their SEO strategies now, while others retreat, are the ones positioned to lead for the long haul.</p>
<p>As others slash their SEO budgets, you’ll be investing in content and technical upgrades that deliver compound returns.</p>
<p>While they fixate on whether AI will replace search, you’ll be building the authority those systems rely on.</p>
<p>Start with a content audit. </p>
<p>The AI revolution isn’t coming – it’s already here.</p>
<p>The question isn’t whether search will change. It’s whether you’ll move fast enough to own the shift.</p>
<p>Your competitors are choosing hesitation. What will you choose?</p>
