<p>The number of websites linking to this post.</p>
<p>This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic.</p>
I asked our ace data scientist, Xibeijia, if she could help me build a profile of “AI proof <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a>”.
By “AI proof <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a>” I mean queries that keep (or increase) their clicks, even when AI Overviews are present in the SERP.
Xibeijia ran a small-scale study on Ahrefs’ <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> to find out.
<p>Read on to see what she found…</p>
AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a>s tend to steal clicks.
<p>Google now fields questions natively in the search results using AI, meaning that users don’t always need to click through to websites to find an answer.</p>
Ryan Law and Xibeijia Guan ran a (now famous) study back in April into the CTR impact of AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a>s.
They found that pages lose 34.5% CTR, on average, when the AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a> is present on the SERP.
But, what about the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> that don’t experience a CTR drop—what do they look like, and do they have anything in common?
Xibeijia ran a very small-scale check on ahrefs.com to see if we could learn anything from our own “AI proof <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a>”.
<p>Google Search Console performance in Ahrefs Dashboard</p>
In total, 97 out of 1,393 <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> (~7%) also ranked in a SERP topped with an AI Overview.
<p>As I said, the study was pretty small fry.</p>
<p>But, even so, Xibeijia spotted some interesting patterns in the data.</p>
The <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> that saw stable or increased CTR fell into three categories:
Xibeijia noticed that our “free tools” <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> didn’t experience as much of a CTR decline, despite growing AI Overview presence.
<p>Meaning that utility pages like our Website Traffic Checker and our Free Keyword Generator still caused users to click.</p>
Zero-click search summaries weren’t enough for users in this situation—they had a job-to-be-d<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">one</a>, and they required a tool to do it—which meant they needed to click.
Ahrefs SERP Overview in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> Explorer showing Ahrefs’ free tool—Traffic Checker—losing one organic position, but gaining an AI Overview citation, giving us two chances for clicks.
Some <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> didn’t rank on page one originally, but began ranking in the top 10 or in an AI Overview post-March 13th.
<p>This reaffirms the importance of SEO.</p>
If you optimize your content well, it is still possible to improve CTR in AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a> SERPs—though some industries and content types will likely fare better than others.
Ahrefs SERP Overview in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> Explorer showing one of Ahrefs’ “Top Websites” pages claiming position 7 and an AI Overview.
As Patrick Stox shared recently on the Ahrefs blog, AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a>s aren’t always in the first position in the SERPs—they can actually rank in positions one through six.
In fact, ~8.5% of the time they’re not in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">position</a> one.
In our study, we saw either click-parity or click-growth across SERPs where AIOs ranked lower than <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">position</a> one.
In other words, our data indicates that when AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a>s are not in position one, they don’t take as many clicks away.

This is something we’re going to be testing in more detail, so watch out for an AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a> position CTR study on our blog.
<p>First off, head to:</p>
Export those <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a>, open them in a spreadsheet, and copy all.
Finally, apply the filter “Target &gt; [enter your domain] &gt; show ranking <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">position</a>s”.
This will show you your “AI proof” <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a>—the ones retaining or gaining clicks, despite the presence of AI Overviews.
Check back on this report to see which types of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> you can target to engineer more clicks.
AI Overviews have undeniably changed the search landscape—often to the detriment of organic CTR—but our small-scale study shows that some <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> continue to drive clicks.
<p>So, what makes a keyword “AI proof”? In our dataset, three factors stood out:</p>
Even in zero-click search, some <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">keywords</a> still click.
So carry on tracking your keyword performance, and keep an eye on where AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">overview</a>s appear in your SERPs.
