<p>Published on July 29, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>For over a decade, Google’s search results and Knowledge Graph treated “our” Danny Goodwin – the editorial director of Search Engine Land and SMX – as the same person as the Hall of Fame baseball player who shares his name.</p>
<p>This is a worst-case scenario for entity optimization and knowledge panel management: a self-reinforcing algorithmic mix-up, complicated by a very famous namesake with a Wikipedia page.</p>
<p>The situation was severe:</p>
<p>About a year ago, I took on one of the toughest entity optimization challenges I’ve seen:</p>
<p>This article breaks down how that transformation (almost fully) happened – and what it took to get there.</p>
<p>In entity optimization for individuals, the biggest challenge is usually name ambiguity – most people share their names with others.</p>
<p>For Goodwin, there are thousands, including a standup comedian, a university professor, and a Hall of Fame swimmer.</p>
<p>In his case, the challenges ran deeper:</p>
<p>Google was absolutely convinced that Danny Goodwin, the baseball player, was the same person as Danny Goodwin of Search Engine Land.</p>
<p>To a human, it’s obviously absurd.</p>
<p>But Google’s Knowledge Graph algorithm relies on the “weight of probability” drawn from public information it can find, digest, and decode. </p>
<p>And in this case, the weight of probability suggested that Goodwin had somehow skipped 20 years and transitioned from professional baseball to SEO.</p>
<p>Google had maintained this belief for at least a decade. </p>
<p>As revealed in the 2024 Google leak, the Knowledge Graph feeds itself with its own synthetic data, reinforcing its existing assumptions over time.</p>
<p>When those assumptions are correct, the algorithm’s understanding becomes impressively strong. </p>
<p>But when they’re wrong, the errors compound until they become exponentially harder to fix.</p>
<p>This was a machine confidently telling itself the wrong story for years. </p>
<p>Undoing that self-reinforcing misunderstanding across dozens of updates is one of the most difficult challenges in knowledge panel management.</p>
<p>The most visible symptom: the misattribution of Goodwin’s articles.</p>
<p>This About this result snippet from October 2024 illustrates the issue. (Note: Our tool tracks historical data like this – though our system occasionally misreads special characters.)</p>
<p>This kind of confusion directly undermines E-E-A-T – or what I call N-E-E-A-T-T: notability, experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness, and transparency.</p>
<p>We know that Google:</p>
<p>The impact becomes even clearer.</p>
<p>The misattribution completely severed the “content creator” link, redirecting all the brand equity from Goodwin’s work to the baseball player’s entity.</p>
<p>The approach to fixing long-standing entity confusion in the Knowledge Graph is the same as building an entity from scratch – just slower. </p>
<p>It’s all about systematically providing Google’s algorithms with an unambiguous, consistent, and corroborated set of facts across the entity’s digital footprint.</p>
<p>It’s about patiently re-educating the machine. I often use the analogy of “teaching Google like you would teach a child.”</p>
<p>The first step was to create a canonical, fully controlled source of truth.</p>
<p>Goodwin didn’t have an entity home, so we built one. </p>
<p>The simplest WordPress site is enough:</p>
<p>On the entity home, we included a biography that opened with a simple statement – a semantic triple:</p>
<p>This gave the algorithm a clear, unambiguous fact to anchor on. </p>
<p>We kept it extremely simple. (Overcomplicating is a common mistake in knowledge panel management.)</p>
<p>Goodwin’s original description was already very clear, so we changed only what was strictly necessary. </p>
<p>The goal of the longer summary was to outline his experience, expertise, and authority in search marketing, with dates – crucial for disambiguating him from the baseball player.</p>
<p>Next, we gave Goodwin a prioritized list of pages to update with a revised description and a link back to his entity home:</p>
<p>In parallel, my team updated relevant third-party sources that allow contributor editing.</p>
<p>This created a self-reinforcing loop of corroboration.</p>
<p>By echoing the same facts and linking to a central hub (the entity home), his digital footprint began sending a clear, consistent signal to Google. </p>
<p>Over time, with each crawl, that consistency built Google’s confidence that danngoodwin.info is the entity home for our Danny Goodwin – and that the information there is accurate and trustworthy.</p>
<p>You can compile a list of pages to update manually, although it takes a few hours. </p>
<p>We used our own tool to automate this by identifying and prioritizing the pages most likely to influence Google’s knowledge algorithms. (The 2024 Google leak confirmed the importance of isReferencePage).</p>
<p>In general, author pages tend to carry the most weight, so a good rule of thumb is to start with those – along with social profiles and key industry sites. </p>
<p>Other sources that are often influential include:</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem easy to guess which pages count as isReferencePage for an entity. </p>
<p>But these signals vary by entity, and well-known sources like Wikipedia or Crunchbase aren’t always as dominant as expected.</p>
<p>As of July, Wikipedia and Wikidata together account for just 12.15% of the 1.5 million unique URLs we’ve identified as reference sources for 7.7 million entities.</p>
<p>Note: This dataset is weighted toward corporations and entrepreneurs, so patterns may differ for musicians, authors, and others.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Google’s Knowledge Graph builds understanding and confidence gradually, so patience is essential. </p>
<p>For a person entity, once everything is properly set up, the typical timeline for earning a full Knowledge Panel ranges from 6-12 months. That depends on:</p>
<p>In Goodwin’s case, we expected a longer process due to the deep entanglement with the baseball player. </p>
<p>Still, the outcome came faster than anticipated. The results?</p>
<p>We had a sprout and a place in the Knowledge Graph with the kgmid /g/11gbb7v3gp.</p>
<p>As Google’s confidence grew, the Knowledge Panel blossomed. </p>
<p>We got Knowledge Panel cards on New Year’s Day 2025.</p>
<p>Then a nice, long description Goodwin himself wrote in April 2025:</p>
<p>People also search for, featuring “our” Barry Schwartz – not the psychologist.</p>
<p>This process is rarely linear. </p>
<p>Week to week, Knowledge Panel elements can appear, disappear, and reappear unpredictably. </p>
<p>In this case, both the description and the cards were particularly volatile.</p>
<p>That said, once established, the panel typically becomes stable and reliable. </p>
<p>Reaching that point can take up to two years – though that timeline will likely shorten as Google’s systems evolve.</p>
<p>The one remaining puzzle piece is the isAuthor attribution for Goodwin’s articles. </p>
<p>From the 2024 Google leak, we know how important this signal is and that Knowledge Graph updates happen in slow, iterative waves.</p>
<p>Google has already detached the baseball player from Goodwin’s articles (arguably the hardest part, given the entanglement).</p>
<p>However, isAuthor still doesn’t explicitly point to the correct Goodwin. </p>
<p>That alignment will likely fall into place gradually over the coming months.</p>
<p>We also saw a clear payoff in AI results. </p>
<p>When Google AI Mode launched, it immediately presented the two Goodwins as distinct entities.</p>
<p>That means the work had an impact across the full algorithmic trinity behind AI Mode (and all assistive engines):</p>
<p>That means the work made an impact across the algorithmic trinity behind AI Mode and all assistive engines:</p>
<p>This was one of the trickier challenges I’ve encountered in 13 years of optimizing entities for Brand SERPs, Knowledge Panels, and now LLMs. </p>
<p>But it’s also a great proof point: even entrenched algorithmic confusion can be resolved. </p>
<p>With a structured, clear, and patient approach, you can teach the machine the facts and take ownership of your digital identity.</p>
