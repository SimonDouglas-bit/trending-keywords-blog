        When it first became clear that clicks and user behavior influence rankings, many in the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> industry dismissed it – until it became widely accepted.
Today, the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> vs. GEO debate is sparking similar reactions. 
<p>It’s a healthy conversation, but it also highlights gaps in how we think as a community.</p>
<p>We don’t lack checklists. What we lack is an open mindset – a willingness to admit we don’t know everything about search or LLMs.</p>
Acknowledging that is the first step. From there, we can adopt the mindset we need: one rooted in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a>ing.
Experiments are <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">one</a> of the most effective ways to uncover what actually works – yet most marketers don’t use them. 
<p>In a Harvard Business Review article, the author notes that only a third of senior digital growth managers had ever run digital ad experiments.</p>
While the article focuses on advertising, the same applies to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>. It’s still rare to see SEOs build testing into their strategy. 
In my experience, even explaining what an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> test is – to clients or in-house teams – can be a challenge.
There’s a common misconception that a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a> is only successful if it “passes,” when in reality, both passing and failing yield valuable insights. 
Unfortunately, a failed <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> test is often mistaken for failed SEO work.
<p>Then there’s the developer side – full sprints, backlogs, maintenance, technical debt. </p>
Asking for extra work to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a> something uncertain isn’t exactly a popular request.
All of this contributes to the hesitation – and in some cases, resistance – around testing in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>.
Dig deeper: <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> testing: Shifting from reactive to proactive strategies
There are plenty of experimentation frameworks from product and CRO that can be adapted for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>. 
But for now, the focus is on a data-driven method: the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hypothesis</a>-driven approach.
A hypothesis is an assumption you can <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a>. 
<p>It’s a clear, specific statement about what you expect to happen and why.</p>
<p>Most hypotheses follow an if-then format. For example:</p>
<p>Here’s a simple way to illustrate the process:</p>
You <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a> the hypothesis by asking in those Slack groups. 
If you get a helpful answer, you accept the hypothesis. If not, you reject it and come up with a new <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">one</a>.
It might seem simple, but this is a structured, statistical way to test assumptions – and one we should use far more often in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>.
Dig deeper: 6 <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> tests to help improve traffic, engagement, and conversions
<p>Let’s say a client hires you because they lost traffic after a migration and need help recovering it.</p>
A traditional <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> might start with audits and checklists – a “pray and spray” approach I often talk about. You try to do everything right, hoping something works and traffic returns.
<p>But this method is time-consuming, costly to execute, and offers little learning. </p>
<p>You’re applying the same checklist to every site, without considering new tactics or gaps in your current workflows.</p>
The <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hypothesis</a>-driven approach, by contrast, is more strategic and data-informed. 
<p>You begin by listing all potential causes based on your experience, analysis, and knowledge:</p>
Then, you choose <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">one</a> as your starting hypothesis – the issue you believe is most likely. For example:
<p>You audit the redirects, identify any that are broken or missing, and recommend fixes.</p>
If traffic begins to recover, your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">hypothesis</a> is valid, and the dev team spent minimal effort on it. 
<p>If not, you move on to the next most likely issue.</p>
<p>I’ve always been an advocate of thinking strategically and using data – and this approach supports both. </p>
Here’s why starting with a hypothesis and testing it is, in my view, the best way to approach <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>:
Dig deeper: 5 practical <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> experiments with AI as a co-pilot
Adopting a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a>ing mindset doesn’t just improve existing strategies – it opens the door to discovering new ones.
<p>Take the example of a Bing employee who had an idea to change how ad headlines were displayed. </p>
The idea was buried in a backlog and marked low priority – until an engineer ran an A/B <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a> and uncovered a 12% lift in revenue. Without that test, the idea would’ve been lost.
Despite how quickly the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a> landscape is evolving, there’s still surprising resistance to new ideas. 
It often seems that there’s only one way to do <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">seo</a>, and it starts and ends with checklists.
Whatever your stance, the real question is: Have you <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a>ed it? 
<p>You don’t need to adopt every new concept, but you do need to evaluate them with an open mind.</p>
Let’s not default to skepticism just because something’s unfamiliar. Let’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115023-cognitive-behaviors-that-enable-self-improving-rea.html">test</a> more.
