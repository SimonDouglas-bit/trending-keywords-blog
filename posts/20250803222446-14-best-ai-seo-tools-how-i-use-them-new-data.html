<p>Keeping up with the best AI SEO tools can feel like a full-time job. While we all know that tools help us to do our jobs better and faster, finding the time to research the tools and integrate the new tool into an existing workflow is a considerable undertaking. That’s why I wrote this article.</p>
<p>I’ve been testing AI tools for years.</p>
<p>I was a pretty enthusiastic adopter of AI and started with Jasper before ChatGPT was on anyone’s radar. I earned my Jasper Certification in June 2022, just a few months before ChatGPT launched and AI adoption exploded. Since then, existing tools have layered in AI, and entirely new tools have hit the market at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>This guide will help you make sense of the leading AI SEO tools and how to use them effectively. I’ve been selective about tools included because I didn’t want to write an article listing a bunch of AI for content creation. (I feel like this is the AI we all know about!) Instead, I’ve provided a tool for as many components as AI and SEO as possible, including internal linking, technical SEO, and backlinking.</p>
<p>I’ll uncover the essential features to look for in each tool you consider and share valuable insights gained from testing top solutions. Whether you're a freelancer, in-house marketer, or consultant, this guide will help you identify the AI SEO tools that align with your goals.</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>I’ve worked in marketing for over a decade now. My primary role is SEO, but as the co-founder of boutique SEM agency, Forank, I also use AI tools to help manage the SEO side of my business.</p>
<p>Here are some ways in which AI supports my marketing workflows:</p>
<p>It’s easy to get wrapped up in the AI versus humans argument, but AI doesn't replace humans. It enhances it through intelligent automation. AI unveils insights and optimization opportunities that would be challenging for SEO professionals to identify manually and in a timely manner.</p>
<p>AI in SEO involves using advanced algorithms, including machine learning and natural language processing, to process and analyze large volumes of data, allowing SEO professionals to optimize their SEO strategies and automate specific tasks.</p>
<p>Simply put, AI allows SEO professionals to do the work they love while they outsource the time-consuming and mundane.</p>
<p>The impact of AI on SEO is significant, with 98% of organizations increasing AI usage. Better, marketers are measuring AI success in the form of ROI across many dimensions, including:</p>
<p>According to HubSpot’s recent State of AI report, data shows that 86% marketers who use AI for creative ideation save an hour a day, which equates to 37 working days per year, assuming a working day is five days per week and seven hours per day.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key ways I’ve used AI in my SEO process.</p>
<p>LLMs like ChatGPT and Perplexity are pretty useful for brainstorming topics based on your target audience.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m using ChatGPT more than anything else.</p>
<p>To get the most out of topic brainstorms, try a strong prompt like:</p>
<p>I'm creating a content strategy for a leading [industry] brand. I need content ideas tailored to my target audience, who are [demographics, psychographics, job roles, industries].</p>
<p>They are typically at the [awareness/consideration/decision] stage of the buyer's journey and struggle with [pain points, common challenges]. Their key goals are [primary objectives or motivations].</p>
<p>We’ve already created content on [list existing content], and our top-performing content includes [examples or content types that have resonated well]. However, there are gaps in our content around [missing topics, underperforming themes], which we’d like to address.</p>
<p>Right now, I want to focus on the topic cluster of [main topic or theme], and ideally generate ideas that explore related subtopics such as [related keywords, long-tails, semantic variations]. It would be helpful to factor in [seasonal trends, news, industry updates], if relevant.</p>
<p>Please generate ideas for the website, including [service pages, landing pages, blog posts]. The content should support our goals of [increase traffic/drive leads/educate/generate backlinks/improve engagement].</p>
<p>Our key competitors are [competitor names or content examples], and I’d like to differentiate our ideas from theirs by [unique POV, targeting a niche angle, depth, storytelling, etc.].</p>
<p>We plan to promote this content primarily via [SEO and the website], so please factor this into the ideation.</p>
<p>Pro tip: if you export your sitemap to an XML file, those on ChatGPT subscriptions can provide the file, and ChatGPT will analyze and understand topics already covered, which might help the ideation process. You can also add competitor sitemaps if you’re interested in closing content gaps.</p>
<p>Technical SEO can feel like a minefield. It’s complex and there’s nearly always a lot to do, especially on a site that’s been a little neglected. Usually, it’s nothing to worry about, but lots of little issues that are better resolved.</p>
<p>Technical SEO can become more palatable with AI and SEO tools that bring issues to the forefront and break down how to fix them, and how important they are.</p>
<p>Here’s what that looks like in HubSpot:</p>
<p>The prioritization helps you see what’s high priority, how difficult it is to fix, and which role is responsible for resolving it.</p>
<p>You can complete keyword research with LLMs. It’s a good way to get ideas, but I’d be careful assuming that LLMs know what keyword search volumes are. Using LLMs for keyword research with a keyword research tool is best.</p>
<p>I like Semrush’s Keyword Magic Tool for this, or there’s Keywords Everywhere for a cheaper alternative.</p>
<p>Research with AI is undoubtedly faster with AI than without. Here are some use cases for how AI speeds up research:</p>
<p>Research for content briefs is made so fast with AI. The AI can do the foundations of brief creation incredibly well, so you can spend time adding value and E-E-A-T.</p>
<p>AI tools like SurferSEO have content optimizers that use AI. Content tools can help you spot gaps in your content to ensure you create the most detailed content on the web, giving you the best chance of ranking.</p>
<p>AI in content is nothing new. I’ve used Grammarly for years. While not an SEO tool per se, Grammarly’s AI brings a lot of benefits to SEO:</p>
<p>Within Google Analytics (GA4), AI features (insights) make light work of gathering and understanding data. Instead of manually navigating to reports and filtering them, you can use natural language to ask about specific KPIs.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Structured data and schema is a great use case for AI because it allows SEO teams to generate schema even if they're not the most technical.</p>
<p>I use ChatGPT for this. I ask the tool to help me create a specific type of schema. It’s useful because schema has different properties and types, and the LLM can recommend which properties can be used with which types.</p>
<p>Start by asking which properties and types you can use, then go ahead and generate the schema. The AI will do it for you.</p>
<p>Important note: The AI doesn’t always get it right. It’s important to validate the schema using the Schema Validator tool. Also, you must check the schema with a technical SEO or schema professional who knows how to implement schema correctly. Even the Schema Validator tool can only confirm whether or not your schema is technically accurate; it cannot tell you if the properties and types are used correctly.</p>
<p>AI's data processing capabilities can help you develop a smarter content strategy that prioritizes and aligns with your target audience's needs.</p>
<p>For instance, use an AI-powered toolkit to analyze survey data, customer reviews, interviews, and sales call records to uncover valuable insights for your messaging.</p>
<p>These insights will help you identify high-value keywords and topic clusters to target. Additionally, you can uncover gaps, opportunities, and trends.</p>
<p>From there, you can map out a focused content calendar that targets high-opportunity terms and create content formats that resonate with your audience.</p>
<p>While you should focus on implementing your SEO strategy, use AI to automate repetitive tasks that are challenging to manage at scale, such as:</p>
<p>For example, an AI content optimization tool can suggest improvements, but changes must always be reviewed and approved manually.</p>
<p>Before publishing your content, use an AI SEO tool to suggest and automatically create internal links within your website.</p>
<p>This can improve ‌site structure and user experience and help distribute link equity more effectively.</p>
<p>As an SEO professional, I’ve been testing AI-powered tools for SEO for years. In fact, I’ve written many articles for HubSpot covering topics like this.</p>
<p>Here are two favorites:</p>
<p>I’m always eager to see how the latest AI SEO tools can help me improve my SEO workflows and drive better results.</p>
<p>All that said, I’m conscious that not all AI SEO tools are created equal. For this article, I’ve kept my testing and recommendations fair using the following criteria:</p>
<p>While your specific needs and preferences will determine the AI SEO tool you pick, there are essential features that every dependable AI SEO tool should have.</p>
<p>To help you select the most effective solution, consider these features and capabilities:</p>
<p>Look for tools that incorporate advanced natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms.</p>
<p>As you do this, don‘t just take the vendor’s word for it. Dig into ‌documentation, examine case studies, and seek user feedback on platforms like G2 and TrustRadius.</p>
<p>A robust AI core will have a track record of success and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>The tool you choose should cover crucial aspects of SEO, from conducting in-depth keyword research to optimizing on-page content, from performing technical site audits to tracking data to improve rankings in real time.</p>
<p>It should also provide insights into your competitors‘ strategies, giving you a comprehensive view of your SEO landscape.</p>
<p>These specialized features ensure that you get generic AI assistance and targeted support for your SEO efforts.</p>
<p>No tool exists in isolation. The most effective AI SEO tools offer seamless integration capabilities through APIs and connectors, allowing them to work well with your existing tech stack.</p>
<p>The integration process should also be straightforward and cause minimal disruption to your workflow.</p>
<p>Look for tools that have established partnerships with leading platforms, which often indicates better integration possibilities.</p>
<p>Even the most advanced AI SEO tools can't replace good old-fashioned customer support. Seek out vendors known for their reliability and commitment to product development.</p>
<p>They should offer quick, accessible technical assistance through multiple channels.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the tool's ability to handle increasing amounts of data and usage without compromising speed or accuracy.</p>
<p>Your AI SEO tool’s pricing should be flexible, offering options that fit various budgets and needs.</p>
<p>Remember, the most expensive option isn't always the best, so look for a balance between cost-effectiveness and reliable performance.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, you can identify an AI SEO tool that meets your current needs and can evolve alongside your business, providing long-term value in your SEO efforts. Let’s look at the 21 best AI SEO tools.</p>
<p>I have included free and paid tools to help with all parts of the SEO process, including strategy planning, content optimization, and technical SEO.</p>
<p>Price: Create a bundle to get a quote.</p>
<p>Best for: Writing marketing copy.</p>
<p>I use HubSpot’s suite of AI tools to work more efficiently, develop my SEO strategy, and create optimized content that ranks higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>
<p>What I love about these tools is that they are designed to allow for easy transitions between manual and AI-assisted creation, giving me the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing about HubSpot’s AI-driven content generation tools is that they’re adept at generating copy for various needs, from blog posts to landing pages to marketing emails.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use HubSpot:</p>
<p>What I like: HubSpot’s AI-powered tools are designed to complement your creative process, offering the flexibility to toggle between manual and AI-assisted content creation. It facilitates enough efficiency to produce high-quality content at scale.</p>
<p>Bonus: HubSpot's Blog Ideas Generator uses AI and Semrush keyword data to craft optimized blog post titles, outlines, and content.</p>
<p>Best for: Monitoring AI analytics.</p>
<p>Speaking of HubSpot's AI tools, we recently launched a powerful new one. AI Search Grader is a powerful free tool designed to analyze your brand for today’s AI search engines.</p>
<p>This tool allows you to see how (and if) your brand shows up in AI search results and helps you understand how models — like ChatGPT and Perplexity — view your products or services.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use HubSpot’s AI Grader:</p>
<p>What I like: Let‘s face it — today’s search landscape is pretty tumultuous. AI Search Grader shows where you're doing well and where you can improve to increase brand awareness and sentiment beyond traditional search.</p>
<p>Price: There are multiple packages for Semrush. Given the depth of my work, I’ve used Guru for the last five years. The smallest package, Pro, is $139.95/month, Guru is $249.95/month, and Business is $499.95/month.</p>
<p>Best for: Overall SEO analysis.</p>
<p>Semrush is an agency-focused SEO toolset that helps develop effective SEO strategies and easily solve current SEO challenges. It’s a comprehensive tool, and I log into Semrush daily.</p>
<p>I was a Guru subscriber long before AI was part of the package, and Semrush’s AI features have made it even better.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use Semrush’s AI:</p>
<p>What I like: Semrush is a comprehensive solution to tackle today's SEO challenges head-on. I have used this tool for many years and haven’t looked back; I highly recommend it!</p>
<p>Alternatives: Semrush is an expensive tool, so try SE Ranking if you’re looking for a cheaper alternative. Over the years, I’ve paid for and tried both. SE Ranking is good, but it doesn’t have the largest database of keywords and backlink data compared to Semrush, and I didn’t like SE Ranking’s UX as much, but that’s my personal preference. I didn’t last long on SE Ranking and switched back within months.</p>
<p>Price: WriterZen’s pricing is straightforward and incredible value, considering what the tool does. The starting price is $135, but I highly recommend the content creation tool, which is $270. Alternatively, you can go all in for $405, which is what I did.</p>
<p>Best for: Creating content briefs.</p>
<p>WriterZen is one of my favorite SEO tools. It’s designed to make content marketers’ lives easier and does this very effectively.</p>
<p>Within WriterZen, you can manage your entire content workflow, from briefings (created with AI) to content writing, either with an AI workflow or with human writers.</p>
<p>WriterZen offers a lot, including topic discovery and keyword clustering, which is also excellent as it clusters keywords based on what’s ranking in SERPs instead of just clustering semantically.</p>
<p>Although I’ve used WriterZen for many years, I use it mostly for creating briefs, and I love it.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use WriterZen:</p>
<p>The AI brief creation feature is fantastic and saves so much time. The tool brings SERPs into one console, and you can click through articles and analyze all of the headings and a summary of what articles include.</p>
<p>With a click, you can add headings to your own article to create your outline. Within five minutes, you’ll have the foundations of a content brief. There’s still work to do, but I like how WriterZen balances human analysis and AI. It’s perfect. You can go all-in on the AI if you want to and have a done-for-you brief, but I like to be involved in the process.</p>
<p>Once you’ve got your brief, you can write the whole thing within the tool or use their generative AI.</p>
<p>What I like: I met the WriterZen team in Vietnam a few years ago, which contributed to my fondness for the platform. I think it delivers exceptional value for the price and is so intuitive, too.</p>
<p>Alternatives: There are a lot of good alternatives for this type of work. I’ve also used and paid for Frase, and I thought it was great! ClearScope and SurferSEO are other examples.</p>
<p>Price: $219 per month.</p>
<p>Best for: SEO optimizations during the edit phase of the writing process.</p>
<p>Surfer SEO is a comprehensive AI-powered tool that accelerates content creation while optimizing for search engine rankings.</p>
<p>Its standout feature is the ability to generate high-quality content briefs and outlines tailored for top search performance.</p>
<p>By analyzing top-performing content, Surfer identifies crucial elements such as topics, word count, and semantically related terms needed to outrank competitors.</p>
<p>This data-driven approach provides a solid strategic foundation for content creation.</p>
<p>Surfer's AI capabilities extend to full content generation in ten languages, a valuable feature for managing multi-lingual content demands and streamlining global content workflows.</p>
<p>The tool employs a two-step process: first, it generates an outline for review, then proceeds to a full draft. This approach allows for quality control and course correction before investing significant effort.</p>
<p>Surfer AI can automatically determine the best tone of voice for each article based on SERP analysis or match your brand's unique tone.</p>
<p>Additionally, the tool provides automated optimization and the ability to scan SERPs to find the optimal tone of voice for each article.</p>
<p>What I like: SurferSEO generates an outline first, which you can review and change before it creates a full blog post.</p>
<p>Price: Starts at $77 per month.</p>
<p>Best for: Internal linking.</p>
<p>Link Whisper is a powerful WordPress plugin that simplifies and enhances website internal linking.</p>
<p>This tool is particularly beneficial for content-heavy blogs and sites with extensive archives, as it helps maintain a robust internal linking structure, which is crucial for SEO and user navigation.</p>
<p>The tool significantly reduces the time required for internal linking, transforming what used to be a time-consuming task into a quick, efficient process.</p>
<p>The setup process for Link Whisper is straightforward and user-friendly. Once activated, it integrates seamlessly into the WordPress dashboard, offering a clean and intuitive interface. This ease of integration makes it accessible even for those who may not be highly technical.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use LinkWhisper:</p>
<p>Link Whisper excels at providing intelligent internal linking suggestions. When editing a post, a dedicated “Link Whisper” section displays contextually appropriate internal links based on a thorough scan of the entire site.</p>
<p>This feature ensures that relevant content is interconnected, enhancing the site's SEO and helping users discover related articles.</p>
<p>I use the auto-linking feature a lot. Every time a new page goes live, I use LinkWhisper to find keywords for which I want the page to rank. The AI finds the opportunities, and you can link them automatically or approve them.</p>
<p>Pro tip: I highly recommend approving the links rather than allowing the tool to link them automatically. While the automatic linking is great, it can put links in places you wouldn’t normally, such as within copy on a CTA.</p>
<p>The plugin's AI-driven suggestions are generally accurate, identifying the best places to add internal links. While most recommendations are spot-on, users may occasionally encounter less relevant suggestions, which can be easily adjusted.</p>
<p>What I like: One of LinkWhisper's standout features is its bulk-adding capability. This feature is handy for updating older content, allowing users to add multiple internal links across various posts in a fraction of the time it normally takes.</p>
<p>Price: Starts at $99 per month.</p>
<p>Best for: Local SEO and managing Google Business Profiles.</p>
<p>Paige by Merchynt is unique in the AI local SEO software market because, unlike others, it fully automates your local SEO and Google Business Profile management, rather than simply providing you with suggestions you need to do yourself. Although Paige is AI-powered, you have complete control over how it writes and sounds, giving it your own company voice.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use Paige: I’ve used Paige’s local SEO reporting with heatmaps and find it as accurate as the other Google Business Profile reporting systems.</p>
<p>What I like: This AI SEO tool is 100% automated. You set up your business in about five minutes; then you let it manage everything without bothering you, which makes it perfect for small business owners and marketing agencies, since you can also fully white label it.</p>
<p>Price: Starts at $23 per month.</p>
<p>Best for: Building web pages.</p>
<p>Divi AI is a key tool I like to use for SEO-driven content creation. It integrates seamlessly within the Divi Builder, and is available as both a theme and a plugin, Divi AI helps users create high-quality, optimized content without requiring extensive SEO knowledge or manual effort.</p>
<p>Divi AI's deep understanding of your website’s context sets it apart. Unlike basic automation tools, it intelligently generates keyword-rich content that aligns with search intent and user needs. It also analyzes existing copy, refines readability, and optimizes for keywords without overstuffing, ensuring that content remains natural, engaging, and search-friendly.</p>
<p>By integrating Divi AI into your SEO strategy, you can streamline content production, enhance website performance, and maintain a competitive edge, all while saving time and effort.</p>
<p>What I like: Divi AI's SEO-focused writing and content rewriting feature make it really easy to optimize content and expand or shorten content as needed.</p>
<p>Price: Starts at $299 per month.</p>
<p>Best for: Website optimization.</p>
<p>AlliAI helps you easily optimize your website experience for SERPs. One feature I particularly enjoy is its bulk on-page optimization; I use it to set up SEO rules for my entire website. The program also handles code changes on individual pages.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use AlliAI: I’ve also used AlliAI’s automated SEO A/B testing, which uses user behavior data to optimize search page titles and boost organic traffic.</p>
<p>What I like: This AI SEO tool works with all CMS platforms and doesn’t require coding experience, which makes it an excellent choice for anyone new to the technical side of SEO.</p>
<p>Price: Starts at $49 per month (per user).</p>
<p>Best for: Spinning content for a range of purposes.</p>
<p>Jasper is an AI writing assistant that transforms a single brief into a comprehensive set of marketing assets, including SEO blog posts, emails, and social media copy.</p>
<p>Its standout feature is the intuitive campaign dashboard, which significantly simplifies team collaboration by providing a centralized hub for all marketing initiatives.</p>
<p>Jasper truly excels in AI-powered content creation. The tool consistently generates high-quality, engaging, relevant suggestions, proving invaluable when struggling with writer’s block.</p>
<p>Jasper ensures consistent branding by maintaining a brand's unique voice and tone across various content types. It allows users to customize their tone and ensures consistent branding regardless of which team member uses the tool.</p>
<p>This unified, on-brand messaging is crucial for building strong recognition and loyalty with your audience.</p>
<p>What I like: Jasper allows for tone-of-voice customization that helps keep your brand consistent across content.</p>
<p>Price: $165 per month for the lowest package, then $420 monthly, or $675 monthly.</p>
<p>Best for: Backlinking.</p>
<p>Pitchbox is an outreach platform designed for SEO professionals (consultants, agencies, or internal teams) looking to grow their backlink profile. The tools help streamline prospecting, outreach, follow‑ups, and link-building at scale.</p>
<p>How I use Pitchbox:</p>
<p>What I like: Pitchbox offers end-to-end outreach automation. It’s not just about keywords and replying to emails; you’ll find websites and enhance your outreach and workflows with follow-ups and email deliverability management.</p>
<p>If you want to start without breaking the bank, check out my favorite free AI SEO tools. They’ll still save you time and boost SERP rankings.</p>
<p>Note: all these tools have premium, paid versions — but still offer some helpful features at the free level.</p>
<p>ChatGPT is one of the most popular AI-powered chatbots, partly because it has many uses, including some SEO tasks.</p>
<p>While I don’t recommend ChatGPT for long-form content generation, I use it as a quick escape from writer’s block. Specifically, it’s helpful for ideation, keyword brainstorming, and quickly generating ideas for titles and meta descriptions.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use ChatGPT:</p>

<p>What I like: You can save conversations by topic or project, which keeps ideas organized.</p>
<p>Perplexity is one of my favorite research tools because you can upload PDF files to receive a summary of key insights. The free version allows you to upload three files daily, and you can ask multiple questions related to the files you upload.</p>

<p>After hands-on testing and real-world use, one thing is clear to me: AI SEO tools have matured far beyond simple content generators. The best tools today solve very specific problems, whether it's speeding up internal linking, automating technical audits, or building structured content briefs at scale.</p>
<p>My favorite tool among those I tested was HubSpot's AI Tools. Its seamless integration of AI across various SEO functions, from content creation to optimization, impressed me. I found its ability to toggle between manual and AI-assisted creation particularly valuable, as it allowed me to maintain my creative input while benefiting from AI's efficiency.</p>
<p>I was also pleasantly surprised by how some tools, like LinkWhisper, addressed specific SEO challenges I‘ve long struggled with, such as efficient internal linking.</p>
<p>The time savings these tools offer are substantial — a factor I hadn’t fully appreciated before this deep dive.</p>
<p>Whether you're a consultant, agency, or in-house marketer, the takeaway is the same: Start with your SEO goals and workflow, then layer in tools that enhance what you already do so well.</p>
