<p>Published on August 05, 2025</p>

<p>For many years, SEO has been the lifeblood of content marketing. </p>
<p>Keyword research, quality content, blog optimization, and organic traffic became the gospel of lead generation. </p>
<p>But times have changed.</p>
<p>Take the Great Decoupling of organic impressions from clicks as a result of Google’s AI Overviews. </p>
<p>Or the shift in user behavior away from Google search and toward LLM-powered engines, like ChatGPT. </p>
<p>With these changes, and many others, how we think about content needs to change as well.</p>
<p>If your content strategy still relies on keyword lists and Google ranking to move the needle, you risk falling behind. </p>
<p>Future-forward competitors are learning to adapt to the new landscape of assistive engine optimization, personalization, and immersive content.</p>
<p>This article tackles how to move beyond traditional SEO and build a content engine that powers brand demand across search engines and formats.</p>
<p>Demand generation is an area of marketing focused on generating awareness of and interest in your brand. </p>
<p>Demand generation content, then, is content that speaks to the needs of your target audience, gets you noticed, and makes people aware of your products or services. </p>
<p>It isn’t just MQL capture, though. It’s the full system of:</p>
<p>The best demand gen content:</p>
<p>The problem with the traditional “SEO-first” approach to content is that this content typically (not always) involves targeting what people are already searching for. </p>
<p>Which makes sense, because most brands want to capture volume. But this content does little in terms of anticipating users’ questions before they’re asked. </p>
<p>Content in today’s competitive (and comparative) environment needs to create desire, long before your audience even knows what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>Now, SEO still matters. </p>
<p>Most of the traditional approaches to optimization still apply, and I don’t suspect Google will disappear anytime soon. </p>
<p>But SEO should not be the sole driver of discovery or your demand gen strategy. </p>
<p>In 2024, 25.6% of desktop and 17.3% of mobile Google searches ended without a click, according to Semrush data. </p>
<p>And those numbers are only expected to grow, especially with the growing prevalence of AI Overviews, featured answers, etc.</p>
<p>This shows that ranking near the top of the SERPs isn’t always enough to drive immediate traffic to your site from those searches.</p>
<p>Trying to rank at the top is still a worthwhile endeavor, as it increases your chances of being seen. </p>
<p>But there are many more pieces of SERP “real estate” for users to see before they ever decide to click on your site.</p>
<p>When users can get answers without having to click through, you lose the ability to move prospective “visits” through the funnel. </p>
<p>Also, the highest value keywords you want to rank for are probably the most competitive. </p>
<p>Hundreds, if not thousands, of brands are publishing content optimized for the same keywords. And there are only 10 spots to rank. </p>
<p>Even if your content is technically better, it still might not stand out. You’re competing against the authority and relevance of other domains – often, big players.</p>
<p>Chasing keywords, then, doesn’t quite work as well as it used to. So, your approach to content needs to be revisited.</p>
<p>Google is still the leading search engine in town, but the prevalence of LLM-driven engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity is shaking things up. </p>
<p>Users are now able to ask uber-specific questions, receive personalized answers, and seek further clarification on those answers within the answer engines.</p>
<p>They don’t necessarily need Google or you to tell them what they need to know or want to hear.</p>
<p>Also, there are other channels driving the conversations – Instagram, podcasts, Reddit, YouTube, and forums, just to name a few. </p>
<p>A growing portion of B2B buyers spend more time on self-directed research across these types of channels, Gartner reports.</p>
<p>This means that you need to engage potential buyers where they actually are, not just where search engines decide to place you. </p>
<p>If you want to generate real, tangible demand for your brand, you need to shift your content strategy away from keywords and toward buyer behavior. </p>
<p>That means creating content in anticipation of buyers’ needs, questions, comparisons, and buying triggers. </p>
<p>Here’s how to do that.</p>
<p>Don’t ask “What are people searching for?” </p>
<p>Instead, ask “What are people debating internally before they buy?”</p>
<p>Any SEO tool can surface keywords like “best restaurant POS” or “best POS for cafes,” but they won’t drive the strategy in terms of addressing buyer friction points, comparisons, etc.</p>
<p>And the importance of addressing friction points becomes obvious when you do any LLM search for your keyword…</p>
<p>Here, we see ChatGPT’s output for “best POS for restaurants,” where it organizes recommendations by: </p>
<p>It then prompts you as to whether you’d like to see a “comparison chart” of these options side-by-side.</p>
<p>Targeting and ranking for “best restaurant POS” is:</p>
<p>So, instead of creating a “Best Restaurant POS” page or listicle, create content like:</p>
<p>These topics come from actual buying friction. </p>
<p>They don’t simply target high-search-volume keywords but contain valuable information that aids the buyer’s decision and can easily be interpreted by LLMs. </p>
<p>Also, this content tends to work better for cross-channel repurposing, such as in email, paid social, and sales enablement, not just organic search.</p>
<p>Aren’t sure what friction points to address? </p>
<p>Talk to your sales team and customer success managers.</p>
<p>The phrases buyers use in calls and email threads are content goldmines. </p>
<p>It’s also worth checking out ChatGPT and the like to find “gaps” that might be missing in your content (e.g., product features and benefits, brand comparisons, pricing tables, etc.)</p>
<p>Traditional SEO often depends on tools like Semrush or Ahrefs to surface content opportunities. </p>
<p>While this data is certainly valuable, it only really tells you what people are searching for, not what they are actually consuming/interacting with.</p>
<p>First-party data sources, such as Google Analytics 4 or your website’s native analytics, can provide valuable insight into:</p>
<p>With this information, you’re better positioned to create content based on what your target audience is most interested in and what will drive them to take action, rather than chasing monthly search volume. </p>
<p>Here are a few good sources of user behavior data:</p>
<p>First-party analytics can help guide your demand generation strategy in a few ways. </p>
<p>For one, it can help you address gaps in your existing content, especially if you see users falling off after a particular page. </p>
<p>It can also help you better leverage (CRO-wise) the content that’s performing well, to hopefully generate more conversions from your most popular content.</p>
<p>For example, if your GA4 data shows that you have a service page that gets a lot of clicks but few conversions, you might want to add content like: </p>
<p>Or, if you see from your CRM that leads often drop off after downloading your gated content, consider following up with a targeted email campaign with a subject line like:</p>
<p>Don’t rely solely on search volume to drive your content strategy. Volume without relevance will not generate the results you want!</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Demand generation content is not just about lead capture. It’s a tool for generating user interest, addressing friction points, and continuing the sales conversation. </p>
<p>Who said your best content needs to live on your website? There are many different content formats that can be used to drive sales.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing all of your time on web pages and blogs, think of different content assets your sales team could use to support their conversations with prospective customers.</p>
<p>It is important to have content that addresses top-of-funnel interests and bottom-of-funnel buying considerations, and your website should include places for this. </p>
<p>But often, the difference makers occur in the conversations prospective customers have during trials or with your sales team.</p>
<p>Demand generation content should build buyer confidence. Buyer confidence shortens the sales cycle. </p>
<p>Better content leading to higher impact means a better ROI for your business – and this can happen during Sales, not just through content on your website.</p>
<p>Users are spoiled for choice when it comes to “helpful” content. </p>
<p>Any Google search is likely to produce a surplus of listicles, guides, videos, etc. </p>
<p>While “value” may be the goal, this content is often created with SEO in mind – high word count, keyword dense, etc.</p>
<p>But what many brands fail to do is offer a distinct point of view. </p>
<p>People don’t want to read another article they can find anywhere else (and what Google AI Overviews can summarize for them). </p>
<p>They want something actionable, unique, thoughtful, etc. – something that will make their lives better!</p>
<p>So, how do you do that in content?</p>
<p>First, you start with a hook. Ideally, one that taps into a tension your audience already feels. It could be:</p>
<p>Hooks don’t just grab attention. They immediately communicate the relevance of your content to user interests. </p>
<p>Then, you make your argument. Instead of regurgitating the same old information, connect the dots your way. </p>
<p>For example, instead of a boring guide on “How to Create and Send an Invoice,” show a real customer using your platform to create an invoice step by step. </p>
<p>For another example, a typical “10 Best Summer Dresses for Summer” listicle becomes “10 Girlies Top Picks – What We’re Wearing This Summer,” with reviews from real customers. </p>
<p>In short, try to:</p>
<p>Bring something interesting to the SERPs!</p>
<p>In demand gen, this isn’t about being contrarian for clicks. </p>
<p>It’s about helping the reader see their problem differently, and how they can find the solution outside traditional methods and in your product/service.</p>
<p>Now, you’ve created all this good content. That’s great. But you want it to get seen!</p>
<p>The traditional approach to content marketing was to wait for SEO to do its thing. That can take weeks or months. </p>
<p>Who wants to wait to see results?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are many platforms available if you want to get your content in front of customers. You just need to identify the right ones. </p>
<p>For demand generation, these platforms tend to work the best:</p>
<p>There are others. </p>
<p>It’s important to narrow your focus to the channels your prospective buyers tend to use most and that align with their shopping behaviors.</p>
<p>Your Google Analytics can be a great source of identifying where your referral or social traffic is coming from. </p>
<p>Your sales team may also have insight into where you get most of your business.</p>
<p>The misconception that you need to be everywhere is exactly that – a misconception. </p>
<p>It’s better to create highly targeted content that appeals to the audience on that particular platform, rather than a wide-cast blast of content to every outlet.</p>
<p>Also, you can usually optimize your content for search engines at the same time, for good measure. Long-term potential plus quick gains!</p>
<p>Lavender is an AI email assistant and sales intelligence platform designed to help reps move faster and close more deals. </p>
<p>But what really sets them apart isn’t just the product – it’s the content strategy behind it.</p>
<p>While they have a blog, it’s far from your basic “top guide” type content. </p>
<p>Just take, for example, some of their recent topics: </p>
<p>Also, their LinkedIn presence is consistently valuable, entertaining, and tactical. </p>
<p>They have a clear POV and humorous tone of voice and are shaking up online conversations. </p>
<p>Through this content, prospective customers can discover the brand, engage in conversations, and walk away with something new. </p>
<p>And in the sea of other AI tools, this differentiation is essential. </p>
<p>They share this content on the platforms that matter most to them – well before it hits the Google ranks. </p>
<p>SEO content still has its place, but the traditional approach to optimizing content for search engines has been shaken up. </p>
<p>There are many more “no click” options for users to consider than ever before. </p>
<p>Ranking at the top isn’t a foolproof strategy.</p>
<p>A more adaptive approach to content creation is needed for brands to generate new demand and customer interest. </p>
<p>This requires content that addresses user friction, communicates a clear POV, and attracts users at relevant channels. </p>
<p>It also requires looking outside SEO tools for topic ideas and data. It’s not only about what’s searchable.</p>
<p>The more you can differentiate your brand, the better. </p>
<p>And the more you can be adaptive to the LLM-dominated landscape, the less dependent you will be on the SERPs to drive your brand’s traffic and sales. </p>
