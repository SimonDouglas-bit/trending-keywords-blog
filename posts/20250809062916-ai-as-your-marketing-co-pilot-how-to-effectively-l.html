<p>Letting AI drive your SEO strategy is like letting a GPS decide your vacation. It’ll get you somewhere, just maybe not where you wanted. Here's how to stay in control.</p>
<p>I remember seeing those “God is my co-pilot” bumper stickers since I was old enough to read them.</p>
<p>I was a precocious little agnostic, so they always struck me as weird. God can’t be your co-pilot because God isn’t a physical manifestation of someone who can help you drive a car.</p>
<p>I eventually figured out that “God is my co-pilot” was less a literal statement and more a declaration of faith that there is an omniscient presence available to help you navigate life’s construction zones (if you believe, anyway).</p>
<p>So, fast forward to 2025, and marketers have a new omniscient presence that they can put their faith in. Something that seems equally all-knowing but perhaps a little more … unpredictable.</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) – like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini – feel delightfully divine when you first try them. They answer instantly, confidently, and often with an authority that makes you wonder if they do know everything.</p>
<p>But, spend enough time with these tools, and you discover something unsettling: AI isn’t just your god-like guide. It can also act like the devil, gleefully granting your wishes exactly as asked – and letting you suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>This is why the healthiest way to think of AI in your SEO and content workflows is as a co-pilot. Not God. Not Lucifer. But, a powerful partner that can elevate your work, if you exercise your free will (and make good choices).</p>
<p>There’s a reason AI feels god-like in a marketing context:</p>
<p>Ask it to draft a content brief, summarize competitive search engine results pages (SERPs), generate topic clusters, or even shape a brand narrative – and it performs in seconds what would have taken you hours.</p>
<p>That kind of power can feel miraculous.</p>
<p>But, just as theologians remind us that God’s will is mysterious and not always aligned with ours, LLMs work on their own unknowable internal logic.</p>
<p>The outputs may not match your intent. The answer may not come in the form you wanted. And you may not even fully grasp why it chose the answer it did.</p>
<p>On the flip side, AI can also be a trickster: seductive, transactional, and literal. It will grant you exactly what you wish for – and sometimes that’s the worst thing possible.</p>
<p>When you prompt an LLM poorly, you’re effectively making a deal with the devil. The model will fulfill your request to the letter, even if what you asked was misguided, incomplete, or poorly articulated.</p>
<p>The result? Content that’s technically correct but off-brand, off-tone, or even factually wrong – yet delivered with such confidence it lulls you into publishing it.</p>
<p>The moral: Be careful what you ask for. The clarity of your prompt determines the quality of your output.</p>
<p>When treated as a co-pilot, not as a god, AI can supercharge your workflow:</p>
<p>It’s like an intern with infinite energy and decent taste – incredibly helpful, but still in need of supervision.</p>
<p>Don’t confuse the fluency of AI with wisdom. Here’s where it stumbles:</p>
<p>It doesn’t understand your brand’s unique sensibility, your audience’s emotional context, or when not to say something. You have to give it that context and direction. You cannot assume it will figure it out.</p>
<p>It is still prone to “hallucinations” – confidently wrong statements presented as fact.</p>
<p>We have limited understanding of why this happens, but it is so frequent that you almost have to assume there are at least a few hallucinations in the output somewhere.</p>
<p>It cannot make decisions, nor does it bear the consequences of your choices. That’s on you.</p>
<p>In short, AI lacks your free will. And free will is what allows you to question, interpret, and choose what to do with its suggestions.</p>
<p>To work effectively with your AI co-pilot, you need to strike the right balance between trust and control.</p>
<p>Never hand over full control. You’re still ultimately responsible for the vehicle.</p>
<p>Treat AI as a partner – or maybe not even a full partner, more like an exceptionally bright and quick research assistant – but never a replacement for you in any equation.</p>
<p>Don’t assume it “knows what you mean.” Giving the AI instructions is like giving instructions to a particularly clever child who enjoys maliciously complying with your orders, except the AI doesn’t actually experience the joy.</p>
<p>You need to articulate your expectations clearly: format, tone, audience, and purpose. Add as much context and as many constraints as you can. The more data points and context you can provide, the better the outputs will be.</p>
<p>AI can speed up research, help shape narratives, and generate ideas, but it can’t replace your expertise or final judgment.</p>
<p>Never, never, never, never publish output unedited. Always apply your brand’s perspective, always fact-check, and always ensure alignment with your goals.</p>
<p>Read everything you’re about to publish carefully. It’s okay to trust, but always verify.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how that looks in practice:</p>
<p>I recently took a client’s complete keyword ranking report – not just the terms they were tracking, but every single ranking URL and query – and filtered out any URL already on page 1.</p>
<p>Then, I narrowed the data to just rankings in positions 11-20 (to keep it manageable) and fed that into an LLM.</p>
<p>I asked it to estimate the potential lift in organic traffic if each term improved to position 1 and to rank the list by estimated lift, highest to lowest.</p>
<p>But, I also gave the LLM context about the client’s business, explaining what kinds of customers and services were most valuable to them.</p>
<p>Then, I asked the model to highlight the keywords that made the most business sense for this client, because not every keyword you rank for is one you actually want to rank for.</p>
<p>With that context, the LLM was able to match keyword intent to the client’s goals and call out the terms that aligned with their business priorities.</p>
<p>In just minutes, I had a prioritized roadmap of high-impact, high-fit opportunities – something that would have taken hours to produce manually.</p>
<p>Here are some more actionable ways you can incorporate AI into your workflow effectively:</p>
<p>AI can do so much more than just “help you ideate.” It can help you uncover blind spots, repurpose assets, and deepen your strategic thinking, but only when you stay in the driver’s seat to guide and refine the outputs.</p>
<p>I think we tend to treat our collective relationship with AI the same way we look at religion – you’re either a believer or an atheist.</p>
<p>Some have complete faith and trust it without question, while others reject it entirely and are convinced there is nothing there to believe in. The truth is somewhere in the middle (as it often is).</p>
<p>AI can be a powerful, tireless, but imperfect partner. It can help carry and manage heavy mental loads, work with you to map out routes and decide on destinations, but it can not take responsibility for driving the car. That’s got to be on you.</p>
<p>Your free will – your ability to keep your hands on the wheel – is what ensures the journey ends where you intended. If you actually let go, you’re certainly going to crash. You’re asking for assistance, not a magical autopilot.</p>
<p>So, go ahead: Let AI ride shotgun and keep your hands at 10 and two, where they belong.</p>
