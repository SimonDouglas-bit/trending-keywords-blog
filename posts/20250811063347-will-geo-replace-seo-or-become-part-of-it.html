<p>SEO will never go extinct, but it is entering a new evolutionary phase. </p>
<p>As generative AI search engines reshape how people discover information, the definition of SEO needs to include optimizing for generative AI. </p>
<p>It’s time to rethink our framework of SEO as search everywhere optimization, with GEO as a core component of the strategy. </p>
<p>The engines may be changing, but the goal is the same – help answer users’ questions. </p>
<p>Users still want the best answer in the fewest steps. </p>
<p>Generative AI can shorten the path between the query and the action and make it a better experience for the user. </p>
<p>And as Will Scott said in his SMX session on tactical insights for mastering GEO, it all starts with a question.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Will Scott on AI content reuse, schema and semantics, and generative engine optimization</p>
<p>SEO was never just about Google, despite how much we might focus on Google as the default search engine, thanks to its current dominance in market share. </p>
<p>Search specialists have always had to learn how to optimize for each new relevant search tool, from Bing to DuckDuckGo. </p>
<p>The main differences between GEO and SEO are how factors are weighted in each algorithm and how and whether your content appears in each engine. </p>
<p>The move to all-in-one search and solution has been happening for years. The days of 10 blue links are long gone. </p>
<p>Generative AI is the natural evolution of search, from SERP features like featured snippets to tools and calculators embedded in search engines.</p>
<p>Now there is no such thing as traditional search vs. AI search.</p>
<p>It’s all different degrees of AI search. </p>
<p>All top search engines, including Google and Bing, are already integrating AI into how they build their algorithms and display results. </p>
<p>As LLMs have become more powerful, AI will continue to be more deeply embedded until there is no differentiation or separation between it and so-called traditional search.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: From search to answer engines: How to optimize for the next era of discovery</p>
<p>The game is the same, but some of the skills are new. </p>
<p>With both SEO and GEO, you still need to follow the same best practices: </p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Some of the components that were a larger part of “traditional” SEO in the past have become less relevant. </p>
<p>For example, keyword-first strategies have become less relevant over time, as algorithms deranked sites for keyword stuffing. </p>
<p>But keyword research still matters because it tells you about the words people use when searching, and it helps you figure out what info people want to see on your site about a topic. </p>
<p>It can also help you quantify interest and search demand when prioritizing what topics to cover.</p>
<p>Strategies focused on user intent are still the most relevant in the current search meta landscape.</p>
<p>Thinking beyond Google also means considering other places users are searching, including:</p>
<p>Users are already searching on social and forums, and now these platforms feed generative engine inputs too. Distributing content across platforms helps AI see and cite your brand.</p>
<p>The new search everywhere optimization needs to include all of these sources, too. </p>
<p>SEO specialists need to see how your site and brand are showing up on all platforms so you can strategize accordingly. </p>
<p>Mastering GEO is no longer optional. </p>
<p>While generative AI has a small share of the overall search market, at the rate it’s growing, it may become 10% of website traffic by next year. </p>
<p>Start incorporating GEO best practices into SEO workflows now.</p>
<p>Another reason GEO should be included as part of SEO: we need less separation, not more. </p>
<p>We need to get closely aligned with other digital marketing initiatives and resources.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already had conversations with your marketing team and leadership, start with a few basic concepts:</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to integrate GEO with SEO</p>
<p>What could be in store for the future of search everywhere optimization?</p>
<p>“Google” as a verb was named the word of the decade from 2000 to 2009. </p>
<p>For this decade, I predict we’ll see a rise in phrases competing to be as common as “Google it,” though “Ask ChatGPT” and “Perplex it” don’t quite roll off the tongue in the same way. </p>
<p>There’s an opportunity here for a catchy name to become the new defining verb of search. </p>
<p>(Maybe Ask Jeeves can make a comeback with a new AI?)</p>
<p>Check your site’s traffic sources by device in Google Analytics, and you might see a few sessions from smart TVs. </p>
<p>People are already asking questions of AI voice assistants built into their TVs, cars, and smartwatches – nearly any tech that can reach the web. </p>
<p>How would you optimize for a Subaru? </p>
<p>You’d include the right content on your website to make sure your local business is the top pick when a driver asks their car for directions to the nearest dog-friendly restaurants.</p>
<p>Agentic AI systems are the next phase of generative AI, with smart virtual assistants that can semi-autonomously handle tasks, processes, and user interaction.</p>
<p>SEO analysts will need to optimize for these systems too, both with your own site content and by partnering with development teams to build your own agents.</p>
<p>And before someone suggests we need a new acronym like AEO (agentic engine optimization), let’s all agree to include agentic AI as part of search everywhere optimization.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Becoming AI-native: The next leap for SEO professionals</p>
<p>Search engines have been building toward generative search engines for years. </p>
<p>And SEO pros already have the tools to master new generative AI systems. </p>
<p>Now we need to tune them for a different kind of engine. </p>
<p>The good news is we’re already great at learning new algorithms and models on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Generative AI could be the biggest opportunity in our industry right now, if you’re curious and brave enough to embrace it and master it.</p>
