<p>When was the last time you clicked through from an AI-generated answer to a brand website? </p>
<p>These days, it’s rare – thanks to how AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google’s AI Overviews deliver information. </p>
<p>Visibility now means being referenced in trustworthy sources used by LLMs, far beyond your own website.</p>
<p>In this new environment, SEO teams can’t optimize everything on their own. </p>
<p>They need to evolve from executors to internal partners and consultants, working across content, product, PR, data, and engineering to influence visibility where your audience actually finds information.</p>
<p>Still not convinced? Continue reading to learn why SEO is now a company-wide strategy – and how your business should shift to stay competitive.</p>
<p>The traditional SEO mindset focused on ranking, where ranking in Position 1 often meant claiming the lead. </p>
<p>Now, when users turn to ChatGPT, Perplexity, or AI Overviews for a recommendation, the answer is instant. No click-through needed.</p>
<p>To make things even more fun, the information in the AI answer is sourced from multiple sources across the web. </p>
<p>Your site might never appear, even when your brand is there. </p>
<p>And in this new reality, what matters is whether your brand, product, or perspective appears in the AI’s response.</p>
<p>This changes your optimization goals and calls for a complete strategic rethink.</p>
<p>In the AI era, a crucial part of your job as an SEO is shaping how the brand is talked about across ecosystems, not just how it performs on a SERP. </p>
<p>That means you also need to collaborate more closely with teams like content, comms, product marketing, data, and engineering. </p>
<p>Influencing AI visibility is now a shared responsibility.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: AI visibility: An execution problem in the making</p>
<p>The first step in building this new AI strategy is understanding where these tools source their answers and how they choose what to present in their answers.</p>
<p>A big part of this is still a black box. </p>
<p>Studies from Profound, Writesonic, XFunnel, or Rankscale have already provided some insights and lists of the current winners in the AI visibility race.</p>
<p>Here is a quick roundup of the most influential sources:</p>
<p>This list is far from exhaustive, but it shows that visibility depends on being referenced across many platforms and websites. </p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Winning visibility in AI results isn’t something SEO can deliver alone.</p>
<p>If the goal is to get your brand cited in the sources AI tools trust, every department has a role to play – from content and comms to product marketing, PR, data, and engineering.</p>
<p>That means SEO’s role has to expand. It’s no longer just about optimizing owned pages. It’s about acting as an internal consultant:</p>
<p>Below are some examples of how SEO can work with other teams to win AI visibility.</p>
<p>What to expect: Platform-native ideas, structured feedback, and content that “travels” across channels.</p>
<p>Ideal outcome: Content that ranks in search and gets referenced in AI answers.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Chunk, cite, clarify, build: A content framework for AI search</p>
<p>What to expect: SEO review of messaging and guidance on boosting visibility in third-party channels.</p>
<p>Ideal outcome: Products that appear in AI-powered recommendations.</p>
<p>What to expect: Search-backed media ideas and domain recommendations.</p>
<p>Ideal outcome: PR wins that work for awareness and AI discoverability.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Why PR is becoming more essential for AI search visibility</p>
<p>What to expect: Editorial guidance to package research for maximum pickup.</p>
<p>Ideal outcome: Data that’s cited by journalists, bloggers, and AI tools.</p>
<p>What to expect: Clear technical priorities and diagnostics. </p>
<p>Ideal outcome: A site that search engines and AI models can easily find, parse, and trust.</p>
<p>What to expect: Guidance on which customer stories and channels will have the most AI impact.</p>
<p>Ideal outcome: Authentic social proof that AI can pull into relevant answers.</p>
<p>These partnerships work best when SEO teams are embedded early, helping shape campaigns and assets before they’re launched – not after. </p>
<p>When your brand isn’t discoverable, growth quietly stalls. No leads. No pipeline. No presence where decisions are made.</p>
<p>And it rarely looks like failure – it looks like missed potential.</p>
<p>You might be ranking well, but a competitor is the one showing up in AI summaries, Reddit threads, YouTube explainers, and review listicles.</p>
<p>You might launch a great product, but if it’s named in a way no one searches for, it won’t surface where it should.</p>
<p>You might publish valuable research, but if it’s not structured or distributed for AI to reference, it stays invisible.</p>
<p>This is what it means to fall behind today: not being part of the answer when the answer is generated.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: From search to answer engines: How to optimize for the next era of discovery</p>
<p>Visibility today is about being referenced by AI tools. That means showing up on platforms you don’t own and in conversations you didn’t start.</p>
<p>Traditional SEO still matters, but it’s too focused on owned sites. </p>
<p>At the same time, shift how your SEO team works: </p>
<p>The goal isn’t to overhaul everything – it’s to evolve.</p>
