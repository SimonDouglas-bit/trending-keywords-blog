<p>Published on August 12, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>A mirage in the desert looks like water from a distance and can fool even experienced travelers into chasing something that isn’t there.</p>
<p>SEO research can be the same. </p>
<p>It looks like science, sounds legitimate, and can trick even seasoned marketers into believing they’ve found something real.</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman once said people would rather use a map of the Pyrenees while lost in the Alps than have no map at all. </p>
<p>In SEO, we take it further: we use a map of the Pyrenees, call it the Alps, and then confidently teach others our “navigation techniques.”</p>
<p>Worse still, most of us rarely question the authorities presenting these maps.</p>
<p>As Albert Einstein said, “Blind obedience to authority is the greatest enemy of the truth.” </p>
<p>It’s time to stop chasing mirages and start demanding better maps.</p>
<p>This article shows:</p>
<p>Spoiler: I’ll also share a prompt I created to quickly spot pseudoscientific SEO studies – so you can avoid bad decisions and wasted time.</p>
<p>Real research should map the terrain and either validate or falsify your techniques. </p>
<p>Bad research sabotages all of that. Instead of standing on solid ground, you’re balancing on a shaky foundation.</p>
<p>Take one common example: “We GEO’d our clients to X% more traffic from ChatGPT.” </p>
<p>These studies often skip a critical factor – ChatGPT’s own natural growth. </p>
<p>Between September 2024 and July 2025, chatgpt.com’s traffic jumped from roughly 3 billion visits to 5.5 billion – an 83% increase. </p>
<p>That growth alone could explain the numbers.</p>
<p>Yet these findings are repackaged into sensational headlines that flood social media, boosted by authoritative accounts with massive followings.</p>
<p>Most of these studies fail the basics. </p>
<p>They lack replicability and can’t be generalized.</p>
<p>Yet they are presented as if they are the definitive map for navigating the foggy AI mountain we’re climbing.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some examples of dubious SEO research.</p>
<p>AI Overview overlap studies try to explain how much influence traditional SEO rankings have on appearing inside AI Overviews – often considered the new peak in organic search. </p>
<p>Since its original inception as Search Generative Experience (SGE), dozens of these overlap studies have emerged.</p>
<p>I’ve read through all of them – so you don’t have to – and pulled together my own non-scientific meta study.</p>
<p>I went back to early 2024, reviewed every study I could find, and narrowed them down to 11 that met three basic criteria:</p>
<p>The end result (sorted by overlap in %):</p>
<p>These huge discrepancies come down to a few factors:</p>
<p>There are only two noteworthy patterns across the studies:</p>
<p>In other words, Google now seems to rely more heavily on Top 10 results for AI Overview content than it did in the early days.</p>
<p>If we exclude these studies (marked in the graph above) that didn’t disclose the number of keywords, we get this graph:</p>
<p>That’s it. But even then, there are several reasons why these studies are generally flawed.</p>
<p>This isn’t new knowledge. Google filed a patent for generative engine summaries in March 2023, stating that they also use search result documents (SRDs) that are:</p>
<p>Google may not have marketed this until May 2025, but it’s been in plain sight for over two years.</p>
<p>The real overlap of AI Overviews with Google Search depends on the overlap of all queries used, including synthetic queries. </p>
<p>If you can’t measure that, at least mention it as part of your limitations going forward.</p>
<p>Here are three more examples of recent SEO research that I find questionable.</p>
<p>Marketed as “wow, only 8-12% overlap between ChatGPT and Google Search Top 10 results,” this claim is actually based on just two queries repeated a few hundred times. </p>
<p>I seriously doubt the data provider considered this high-quality research. </p>
<p>Yet, despite its flaws, it’s been widely shared by creators.</p>
<p>I covered these in my article, “Is Google really getting worse? (Actually, it’s complicated).” </p>
<p>In short, the study has been frequently misquoted.</p>
<p>A survey with only 1,000 people participating, 200 of them being marketers and small business owners – all of them using ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Yet, they promote the survey, stating that “77% of people in the U.S. use ChatGPT as a search engine.”</p>
<p>Not all SEO research is unscientific for the same reasons. I see four main causes.</p>
<p>Ignorance is like darkness. </p>
<p>At nighttime, it’s natural to have an impoverished sight. </p>
<p>It means “I don’t know better (yet).” </p>
<p>You are currently missing the capability and knowledge to conduct scientific research. It’s more or less neutral.</p>
<p>This is when you are literally incapable, therefore also neutral. You just can’t. </p>
<p>Few people are intellectually capable of working in a position to conduct research and then fail to do so.</p>
<p>Worse than both is when the lights are on and you still decide not to see. Then you don’t lack knowledge, but deny it. </p>
<p>This is described as “Amathia” in Greek. You could know better, but actively seek out not to.</p>
<p>While all forms are dangerous, Amathia is the most dangerous. </p>
<p>Amathia resists correction, insists it is good, and actively misleads others.</p>
<p>You want to be right and can’t see clearly, or openly try to deceive others.</p>
<p>You don’t have to lie to not tell the truth. You can deceive yourself just as well as you can deceive others. </p>
<p>The best way to convince others of something is if you actually believe it yourself. We are masters at self-deception.</p>
<p>Few promote products/services they don’t believe in themselves. </p>
<p>You just don’t realize the tricks a paycheck plays on your perception of reality.</p>
<p>We have the ability to open our minds more than ever before. </p>
<p>Yet, we decide to shrink ourselves down.</p>
<p>This is encouraged in part because of smartphones and social media, both induced by big tech companies, which are also responsible for the greatest theft of mankind (you could call it Grand Theft AI or GTAI).</p>
<p>In a 2017 interview, Facebook’s founding president Sean Parker said:</p>
<p>They don’t care what kind of engagement they get. Fake news that polarizes? Great, give it a boost. </p>
<p>Most people are stuck in this hamster wheel of being bombarded with crap all day. </p>
<p>The only missing piece? A middleman that amplifies. Those are content creators, publishers, news outlets, etc.</p>
<p>Now we have a loop. </p>
<p>We are stuck in social media echo chambers. </p>
<p>We want simple answers, and we are mostly driven by our emotions. </p>
<p>And social media plays into all of that.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>As outlined throughout, we have three points that need fixing. </p>
<p>Philosopher Karl Popper said that what scientists do is to try and prove they were wrong in what they do or believe. </p>
<p>Most of us move the other way, trying to prove we’re right. This is a mindset problem. </p>
<p>Research is more convincing when you try to prove yourself wrong.</p>
<p>Think steelmanning &gt; strawmanning. </p>
<p>Ask yourself if the opposite of what you believe could also be true, and seek out data and arguments. </p>
<p>You sometimes also have to accept the fact that you can be wrong or not have an answer.</p>
<p>A few other things that would improve most SEO research:</p>
<p>I know that we can do better.</p>
<p>Controversial and questionable studies gain traction through attention and a lack of critical thinking.</p>
<p>Responsibility lies not just with the “researchers” but also with those who amplify their work.</p>
<p>What might help bring more balance to the conversation?</p>
<p>Value truth over being first. That’s journalism’s responsibility.</p>
<p>A curious mind is your best friend. </p>
<p>Socrates used to ask a lot of questions to expose gaps in people’s knowledge. </p>
<p>Using this method, you can uncover whether the researchers have solid evidence for their claims or if they are drawing conclusions that their data doesn’t actually support.</p>
<p>Here are some questions that are worth asking:</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that you can ask too many questions and will end up drinking hemlock like Socrates.</p>
<p>To leave you with something actionable, I built a prompt that you can use to assess research.</p>
<p>Copy the following prompt:</p>
<p>Here’s an example output of the study on generative engine optimization:</p>
<p>This study scores high as it follows a robust scientific methodology. The researchers even provided their dataset. (I checked the link.) </p>
<p>Important notes: </p>
<p>That said, working with a structured prompt like this will yield much better results than “summarize this study briefly.”</p>
<p>SEO is not deterministic – it’s not predictable with a clear cause-and-effect relationship.</p>
<p>Most of what we do in SEO is probabilistic. </p>
<p>Uncertainty and randomness always play a part, even though we often don’t like to admit it.</p>
<p>As a result, SEO research can’t and doesn’t have to meet other disciplines’ standards. </p>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is that our industry’s hunger for certainty has created a marketplace for false confidence. </p>
<p>We’ve built an ecosystem where suspect research gets rewarded with clicks and authority while rigorous honesty gets ignored, left alone in the dark.</p>
<p>The mountain we’re climbing isn’t getting any less foggy. </p>
<p>But we can choose whether to follow false maps or build better ones together. </p>
<p>Science isn’t always about having all the answers – it’s about asking better questions.</p>
<p>I like to say that changing someone else’s behavior and standards takes time. </p>
<p>In contrast, you can immediately change yours. Change begins with the person in the mirror. </p>
<p>Whether you conduct, report, or consume SEO research.</p>
