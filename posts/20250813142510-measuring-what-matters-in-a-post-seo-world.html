<p>Published on August 13, 2025</p>

<p>Before anyone panics and sends me angry DMs about SEO being alive and well, you can relax. </p>
<p>I’m not declaring SEO officially dead. (We’ve already had about 3,486 articles on that topic, and guess what: it still isn’t.)</p>
<p>But SEO as we know it? That’s changing – fast.</p>
<p>Google’s AI Overviews, Bing Copilot, and shrinking SERP real estate are all changing search faster than your agency’s patience for “just one more question” emails.</p>
<p>It’s all happening. Which begs the question: when the landscape shifts dramatically, how do we measure success in a “post-SEO” world?</p>
<p>Strap in, friends, this is about to get a bit uncomfortable (but in a good way).</p>
<p>If you’re still sending clients ranking reports and celebrating when “that keyword” climbs from Position 9 to Position 7, it might be time for a chat. </p>
<p>Ranking positions are nice, a bit like finding $5 in your coat pocket that you forgot was there, but they aren’t the full story, and they never really were. </p>
<p>Let’s face it, no one cares if you are position number one if a) it’s for a phrase no one is looking for or b) it leads to zero conversions.</p>
<p>In today’s crowded, AI-enhanced, zero-click, personalized SERP world (yes, I crammed all the buzzwords in), obsessing over positions alone will leave you frustrated.</p>
<p>Instead, it’s time to think bigger:</p>
<p>Now, I’m not suggesting you ignore them completely, but they just don’t give you the full picture anymore. </p>
<p>The same is true of traffic. </p>
<p>Raise your hand if you’ve had a concerned email in the last six months because traffic has dropped, yet enquiries have stayed the same (or, even better, increased).</p>
<p>Dig deeper: SEO KPIs to track and measure success in the age of AI</p>
<p>Post-SEO means stepping outside the comfort of GSC clicks and impressions. </p>
<p>User engagement is no longer a nice-to-have metric. It’s a must-have.</p>
<p>When Google serves AI-generated answers right at the top, you’ve got fewer opportunities to grab attention – so when you do, you’d better hold onto it.</p>
<p>Here’s how we should be measuring success now:</p>
<p>No more bounce rate, sorry bounce fans. </p>
<p>Engagement rate in Google Analytics 4 actually tells you if your visitors are doing something valuable. </p>
<p>UX isn’t just a phrase to chuck about to make you feel super knowledgeable. </p>
<p>It’s becoming a vital part of any SEO work. </p>
<p>SEO’s end goal was always leads or sales. </p>
<p>Measuring form fills, click-to-call buttons, downloads, or newsletter sign-ups is now essential, not optional. </p>
<p>They’re the real measure of whether your audience cares. </p>
<p>Long gone are the “bish, bash, bosh” days of landing, clicking, and buying.</p>
<p>We need to nurture our visitors. </p>
<p>Dig deeper: 12 new KPIs for the generative AI search era</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>CLV might sound painfully corporate, but stay with me. </p>
<p>SEO is marketing, marketing is business, and business wants to know: is this stuff working?</p>
<p>Tracking organic visitors’ lifetime value means examining how SEO-acquired customers behave long-term. </p>
<p>If your SEO is good (and it better be), your CLV from organic traffic should outpace other channels. </p>
<p>Now that’s a metric worth celebrating.</p>
<p>SEO doesn’t exist in isolation anymore. </p>
<p>So the new success markers? </p>
<p>Businesses need to embrace the online world in lots of different ways, and it all needs to be cohesive. </p>
<p>Talking about a topic in your latest blog, make sure this is filtered through to the rest of your marketing activity. </p>
<p>You want to work toward being known as the brand for XYZ.</p>
<p>With almost half of all searches being branded, you need to know that people are searching for your brand name – that’s gold dust. </p>
<p>Track it. Celebrate it. Report on it.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: The new SEO imperative: Building your brand</p>
<p>Zero-click searches (thank you, featured snippets and AI summaries) are here to stay. </p>
<p>Frustrating? Absolutely. </p>
<p>But a useful metric if you view it through a branding lens? Actually yes.</p>
<p>Measure these impressions carefully. </p>
<p>They’re like mini brand-awareness campaigns running 24/7 without the budget. </p>
<p>But keep your eyes open.</p>
<p>If your impressions are skyrocketing without any corresponding clicks or conversions, your SERP visibility might be doing a whole lot of nothing. </p>
<p>Time for a deeper dive.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to track visibility across AI platforms</p>
<p>We recently worked with a client stuck on old-school SEO reporting. </p>
<p>They proudly waved ranking reports for obscure keywords nobody searched for. </p>
<p>So we switched things up. Started tracking:</p>
<p>Within three months, we identified their most valuable organic traffic segments and doubled down. </p>
<p>Rankings became background noise. </p>
<p>Revenue and conversions became the primary metrics.</p>
<p>Everyone stopped panicking when a random keyword dropped two spots. </p>
<p>Overall inquiry numbers went down, but the quality of the leads was getting so much better. </p>
<p>Instead of sitting on countless discovery calls with the wrong people, we were able to target the right leads. </p>
<p>This is where first-party data becomes more and more important.</p>
<p>It’s also where you need open and honest relationships with clients (agency side) or the sales team if you work in-house. </p>
<p>You don’t need fancy, expensive tech to do this. Your existing toolkit already includes the right stuff:</p>
<p>You already have the data. You just need to use it differently.</p>
<p>Clients won’t let go of rankings easily. Rankings are visible, simple, comforting. Who doesn’t like seeing those little green arrows?</p>
<p>But education starts with you.</p>
<p>SEO isn’t going anywhere, but it’s changing fast. </p>
<p>The ways we measure our success need to evolve even faster.</p>
<p>We’re not just “SEO people” anymore.</p>
<p>We’re marketers, brand builders, user-experience obsessives, and yes, even amateur psychologists.</p>
<p>The SERPs evolved. Users changed. AI happened. </p>
<p>Time to update our metrics and celebrate what really matters.</p>
<p>Your clients, your stakeholders, and your team (and even your sanity) will thank you.</p>
<p>Rankings? They’ll mostly take care of themselves.</p>
