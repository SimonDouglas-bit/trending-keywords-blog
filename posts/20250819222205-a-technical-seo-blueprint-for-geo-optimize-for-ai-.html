<p>When it comes to AI-powered search, visibility isn’t just about ranking – it’s about being included in the answer itself.</p>
<p>That’s why generative engine optimization (GEO) matters. The same technical SEO practices that help search engines crawl, index, evaluate, and rank your content also improve your chances of being pulled into AI-generated responses.</p>
<p>The good news? If your technical SEO is already strong, you’re halfway there. The rest comes down to knowing which optimizations do double duty: improving your rankings while boosting your visibility in generative results.</p>
<p>This article breaks down four technical pillars with the biggest impact on GEO success:</p>
<p>Schema has long been essential for SEO because it removes ambiguity. Search engines use it to understand content type, identify entities, and trigger rich results.</p>
<p>For GEO, schema clarity is even more important. LLMs favor structured data because it reduces ambiguity and speeds extraction. If your content is marked up clearly, it’s more likely to be selected and cited.</p>
<p>Focus on evergreen types that improve visibility:</p>
<p>Bottom line: Schema improves your chances of being cited in AI answers, keeping competitors out of the box.</p>
<p>In SEO, speed has been a Google ranking factor since 2010. In GEO, speed is often a qualifier.</p>
<p>Generative engines pull from billions of pages. If yours is slow or unstable, they can skip it in favor of faster, more reliable sources.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Speed could be a tiebreaker between equally relevant sources. Faster pages have higher odds of inclusion in AI-generated answers – and they convert better once users click through.</p>
<p>LLMs rely on clarity. The easier it is for machines to parse and organize your content, the more likely it is to appear in AI-generated results.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Well-structured content signals topical authority, giving your site a better chance of being included in comprehensive AI answers.</p>
<p>Even the best schema, structure, and speed won’t matter if LLMs can’t access or trust your content. Your technical infrastructure underpins GEO.</p>
<p>Bottom line: If search or generative engines can’t crawl, verify freshness, or trust your site, your content won’t be considered – no matter how authoritative it is.</p>
<p>The technical elements that drive GEO success aren’t new. They build on SEO fundamentals you already know: </p>
<p>But in the AI era, these aren’t just best practices – they’re the deciding factors between being featured and being forgotten.</p>
<p>Getting this right will preserve your search visibility and put your content at the center of AI-driven answers.</p>
