<p>A study of 8.7M Google results finds review engagement correlates strongest with Local Pack visibility, with tactics varying by industry.</p>
<p>A new Yext analysis of 8.7 million Google search results suggests many common local SEO tactics don’t perform the same across industries and regions.</p>
<p>The dataset, drawn from the company’s Scout Index, focuses on what correlates with visibility in Google’s Local Pack, not just overall map presence.</p>
<p>The clearest pattern is around reviews. Yext states “Review engagement dominates,” calling it “the most consistent driver of Local Pack visibility across all industries and regions.”</p>
<p>Within the study’s feature rankings, review signals top the list, including review count, new reviews per month, and owner responses.</p>
<p>Businesses with many positive reviews and prompt owner responses tend to outperform competitors.</p>
<p>While profile completeness and timely replies generally help, their impact varies by vertical.</p>
<p>Geography also changes the picture. The Northeast appears less sensitive to many traditional SEO factors, while the South and West are more affected by slow review responses.</p>
<p>Yext calls out weekend response gaps: waiting until Monday can cost visibility, especially in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The practical takeaway is to maintain timely review engagement every day, not just during weekday office hours.</p>
<p>Yext’s Scout Index compiles more than 200 structured data points per business, including review patterns, hours, contact details, media assets, social activity, and Google Business Profile completeness.</p>
<p>The analysis covers six industries across 2,500 populous ZIP codes and compares Local Pack placements against baseline Google Maps results.</p>
<p>Study caveats: This research involves vendor analysis using a proprietary dataset. It reports correlations rather than causal effects. Please consider these findings as directional and validate them in your own markets.</p>
<p>Yext’s conclusion is: “The one-size-fits-all approach seems to be a relic of the past.”</p>
<p>For marketers, this means testing industry-specific and region-specific strategies. Local search performance appears to reflect differences in both what people search and where they search.</p>
<p>Review management is the baseline to get right. Prioritize the cadence and quality of reviews, and respond quickly. Consider ways to cover weekends where delays correlate with lost visibility.</p>
