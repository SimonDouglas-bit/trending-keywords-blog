<p>The local SEO playbook that worked for years no longer delivers.</p>
<p>Even businesses with strong rankings and steady traffic are disappearing from a critical slice of search results.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened to one of my clients last month: </p>
<p>For two years, their moving company held Position 1 for “moving to Birmingham, AL.” </p>
<p>Traffic was steady – until Google’s AI Overviews appeared. </p>
<p>Suddenly, their page was buried below a conversational response that listed three competitors but not them.</p>
<p>The wake-up call? </p>
<p>Over 58% of Google searches now end without a click.</p>
<p>A perfectly optimized page means nothing if AI engines don’t mention you.</p>
<p>This is the new reality of local SEO in the AI age, and it’s reshaping how customers discover businesses. </p>
<p>You aren’t just competing to rank webpages anymore. You’re competing to be cited by AI systems in their responses. </p>
<p>The principles remain, but the tactics have evolved with how results are presented.</p>
<p>GEO is SEO evolved for the AI age.</p>
<p>You’re no longer just optimizing for crawlers. You’re optimizing for AI systems that:</p>
<p>The fundamental shift? </p>
<p>SEO gets you ranked. Modern SEO – including GEO tactics – gets you cited.</p>
<p>Here’s the difference in action:</p>
<p>The second approach gives AI engines exactly what they need to mention your restaurant in conversational responses.</p>
<p>What we once called “SEO” now includes multiple approaches, all working toward the same goal: visibility, whether in traditional Google listings or AI-generated results.</p>
<p>The foundation remains the same: </p>
<p>But now you also need to ensure that the same content is structured for AI systems to understand and cite. </p>
<p>Your schema markup serves both traditional search crawlers and AI engines. </p>
<p>Your customer reviews influence both traditional rankings and how AI systems describe your business.</p>
<p>What’s changed is the format and style of content that gets results.</p>
<p>AI-powered search features in Google and Bing prefer conversational, direct answers over keyword-optimized pages.</p>
<p>ChatGPT and other AI platforms cite businesses that provide clear, authoritative information in natural language formats.</p>
<p>The businesses winning local search right now understand this isn’t about learning completely new skills. </p>
<p>It’s about adapting existing SEO knowledge for how search results are now presented to users.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Want to win at local SEO? Focus on reviews and customer sentiment</p>
<p>The shift from keywords to conversations represents the most fundamental change in local search since Google introduced the local pack. </p>
<p>While customers still type “plumber near me,” there’s a growing trend toward more conversational queries like “Can someone fix my broken toilet tonight?” </p>
<p>This evolving search behavior means AI engines need to understand context, urgency, and specific customer scenarios to provide relevant recommendations.</p>
<p>Entity optimization has replaced pure keyword targeting. </p>
<p>Search engines now evaluate your business through relationships and contextual relevance within your local market. </p>
<p>A restaurant mentioning its partnership with a local farm strengthens both businesses’ entity authority. </p>
<p>AI engines look for these connections to determine which businesses have genuine local expertise versus those just optimizing for keywords.</p>
<p>The rise of zero-click searches creates both challenges and opportunities for local SEO. </p>
<p>When AI-generated responses provide complete answers directly on search pages, your business information must be compelling enough to drive action from those summaries. </p>
<p>Instead of getting traffic to convert on your website, you need to convert customers directly from AI-generated descriptions of your business.</p>
<p>This evolution of local SEO means success requires first understanding how AI systems currently present your business, then strategically influencing those descriptions to drive customer action.</p>
<p>Before diving into optimization tactics, you need to understand how AI systems see and describe your business. </p>
<p>This baseline audit reveals gaps between how you want to be presented and how AI engines actually cite your information.</p>
<p>The most systematic way to audit your AI presence uses what Metehan Yesilyurt calls the “Temperature Zero Trick.” </p>
<p>At temperature 0.0, AI models become completely deterministic, always choosing the most statistically probable response. </p>
<p>This reveals exactly what these systems consider the “default truth” about your business.</p>
<p>Here’s how to test your brand’s AI baseline using platforms like OpenAI’s Playground or Google’s AI Studio:</p>
<p>The mask technique works particularly well for local businesses. </p>
<p>Try prompting “[Your Business Name] (mask)” and see how AI systems complete that sentence. This reveals their strongest associations with your brand.</p>
<p>If AI systems provide specific, detailed responses about your business at temperature 0.0, it suggests strong brand recognition in their training data. </p>
<p>Generic or missing responses indicate opportunities to strengthen your digital presence through the optimization tactics we’ll cover next.</p>
<p>Use the same temperature 0.0 approach to understand your competitive landscape. </p>
<p>Test queries like “best restaurants in downtown Portland” or “trusted HVAC companies serving Dallas” to see which businesses consistently appear in deterministic responses.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the language AI systems use when they do mention your business versus competitors. </p>
<p>This analysis reveals which trust signals and business attributes AI engines currently associate with your brand compared to competitors.</p>
<p>Most importantly, look for inaccuracies or missing information in AI descriptions of your business. </p>
<p>Outdated hours, wrong phone numbers, or incomplete service descriptions signal data consistency issues that need immediate attention before any optimization efforts can be effective.</p>

<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Once you understand how AI systems currently present your business, you can strategically influence those descriptions to improve visibility and drive customer action.</p>
<p>AI engines pull information about your business from the sources they were trained on and continue to reference. </p>
<p>Unlike traditional local SEO, where NAP consistency across directories impacts local visibility, AI citation depends on the quality and accuracy of information at the sources these systems actually use.</p>
<p>Identify where AI systems are currently sourcing your information</p>
<p>Prioritize high-authority sources that AI systems likely reference</p>
<p>Ensure accuracy and depth at your most visible citation sources</p>
<p>Monitor and correct inaccurate information at key sources</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to boost local SEO: 4 AI-driven tactics that get results</p>
<p>AI engines prioritize content that directly answers questions the way humans actually ask them, but there’s a strategic component most marketers miss. </p>
<p>Local search optimization today requires understanding that customers use AI to complete specific tasks, not just find information. </p>
<p>When someone asks, “Where’s the best gluten-free bakery near me that’s open late?” they aren’t researching options – they’re trying to solve an immediate problem.</p>
<p>Write for task completion with natural, conversational language</p>
<p>Provide specific, quotable details that AI systems can cite confidently</p>
<p>Build comprehensive content clusters that anticipate complete customer conversations </p>
<p>Create strategic comparison content that positions your business favorably</p>
<p>Basic local business schema won’t cut it anymore. </p>
<p>AI engines want detailed, specific markup that helps them understand exactly what you do, where you do it, and how customers can engage with your business.</p>
<p>Implement comprehensive service and area schemas beyond the basics</p>
<p>Test schema in real-world scenarios – not just validators</p>
<p>Keep schema current and detailed with location-specific information</p>
<p>Here’s something most marketers miss about AI-powered search: these systems are inherently risk-averse. </p>
<p>When AI engines provide a single answer or recommendation, they don’t want to be wrong. </p>
<p>This creates a “flight to quality,” where trust signals decide which businesses get cited.</p>
<p>For local businesses, this means customer reviews have become exponentially more valuable. AI systems don’t just count your star rating. </p>
<p>They analyze review content to understand your expertise, reliability, and customer satisfaction patterns.</p>
<p>Focus on detailed, service-specific reviews over generic praise</p>
<p>Encourage customers to mention specific outcomes and experiences</p>
<p>Maintain review consistency across all platforms where AI systems gather data</p>
<p>Traditional SEO metrics like keyword rankings don’t capture how AI engines present your business to potential customers. </p>
<p>You need new measurement approaches that reveal your visibility in AI-generated responses and the quality of those citations.</p>
<p>Track AI citation frequency across major platforms</p>
<p>Analyze the sentiment and accuracy of AI-generated descriptions</p>
<p>Test cross-platform entity recognition consistency</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Why Google reviews will power up your local SEO in 2025</p>
<p>Local SEO hasn’t disappeared – it’s evolved. </p>
<p>The core principles still matter: </p>
<p>What’s different is where and how that information gets surfaced.</p>
<p>Start by creating conversation-ready content and consistent entity signals across every platform your business touches. </p>
<p>Answer real customer questions directly, in a language that AI systems can cite with confidence.</p>
<p>Most competitors are still chasing rankings while AI decides who gets mentioned. </p>
<p>That gap is your opportunity to win both rankings and citations, capturing visibility across search listings, local packs, and AI responses.</p>
<p>The businesses that thrive now are those that treat SEO as multichannel discovery. </p>
<p>Master that, and you’ll own your local market no matter how search keeps evolving.</p>
