<p>This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic.</p>
<p>However, over the past months, some SEOs discovered that ChatGPT may have secretly pivoted to using Google instead.</p>
<p>These were all one-off experiments. So, I wondered if it was possible for us to find out the ‘truth’ using data instead.</p>
<p>Here’s what we found.</p>
<p>I asked our data scientist Xibeijia Guan for help with this. Here’s what she did:</p>
<p>On average, ChatGPT pulls 1.78 search queries per prompt, with 75% of prompts triggering exactly two searches.</p>
<p>If ChatGPT were simply pulling from Google’s search results, you’d expect much higher overlap. Instead, 83.39% of ChatGPT’s chosen results don’t appear in Google’s search results at all for the same fan-out queries.</p>
<p>My colleague Louise also studied 15,000 prompts and found that on average, only 12% of links cited by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot appear in Google’s top 10 results for the same prompt.</p>
<p>So, there’s no clear indication that ChatGPT is solely or predominantly using Google as their search engine.</p>
<p>ChatGPT likely uses a hybrid approach where they retrieve search results from various sources, e.g. Google SERPs, Bing SERPs, their own index, and third-party search APIs, and then combine all the URLs and apply their own re-ranking algorithm.</p>
<p>ChatGPT doesn’t appear to be “secretly Google-powered.” Instead, it seems to use a sophisticated multi-source approach.</p>
<p>This makes sense from a product perspective.</p>
<p>OpenAI likely wants to reduce dependence on any single search provider while optimizing for their specific use case: providing accurate, contextual answers rather than general web discovery.</p>
