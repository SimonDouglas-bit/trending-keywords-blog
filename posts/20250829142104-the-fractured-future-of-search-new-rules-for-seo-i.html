<p>Search isn’t dying or being replaced. It’s fracturing.</p>
<p>Consumers aren’t quitting search; they’re just seeing other people. </p>
<p>Google still dominates, but it’s like that long-term relationship that’s gotten, well, complicated. Too many ads, too much clutter, a few questionable AI answers – and suddenly users are sneaking off to hang out with ChatGPT and Claude.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean extinction for SEO. It means the honeymoon’s over – and you need to learn some new moves.</p>
<p>The job now? It’s to play offense in a fractured search landscape.</p>
<p>The following insights come from Kelsey Libert, co-founder of Fractl, who shared them during her webinar and SMX Advanced presentation, How AI is Reshaping SEO: Challenges, Opportunities, and Brand Strategies for 2025.</p>
<p>Fractl’s survey of 2,000+ people shows how quickly things are shifting:</p>
<p>Translation: This isn’t just hype. We’re watching a massive shift, and consumers are already redecorating their digital lives with AI.</p>
<p>Let’s kill this myth that AI content is automatically untrustworthy.</p>
<p>Because here’s the thing: 80% of consumers are neutral or positive toward brands using AI-generated content.</p>
<p>What people don’t trust? Garbage content. You know, AI slop.</p>
<p>What people trust is useful, accurate, authoritative content – whether a human, a robot, or a robot supervised by a human (or even a human supervised by a robot) wrote it.</p>
<p>The winning formula?</p>
<p>This combination can produce better content than what an average writer can crank out alone. </p>
<p>The bar isn’t “is this AI?” </p>
<p>The bar is “is this good?”</p>
<p>One in four executives are saving about seven hours a week with AI. That’s almost a full workday.</p>
<p>But here’s the catch: if your brilliant plan is to take that time and just stuff more crap on your employees’ plates? Congratulations! You’ve turned AI into a burnout machine.</p>
<p>The smarter play? Use AI to ease pressure, not increase it. </p>
<p>Because nothing’s more expensive than replacing burned-out talent. Leaders who get this will keep their best people, their best ideas, and their sanity. That’s a competitive edge no tool can replicate.</p>
<p>AI is like the early days of SEO. It’s a gold rush.</p>
<p>The playing field is wide open. The rewards for moving fast have never been higher.</p>
<p>Yes, the incumbents have resources. But smaller, scrappier brands can move faster than the giants.</p>
<p>The brands that experiment now, take risks, and learn how to win attention in fractured search will walk away with the treasure. </p>
<p>AI isn’t killing SEO. It’s:</p>
<p>The only thing AI is killing? Those who cling to their old playbooks.</p>
<p>The question isn’t whether AI will fracture search. It already has. </p>
<p>The question is: are you ready to go on offense?</p>
<p>Below is Libert’s full webinar presentation. </p>
