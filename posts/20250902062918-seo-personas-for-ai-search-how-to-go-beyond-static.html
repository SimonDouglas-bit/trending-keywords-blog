<p>Published on August 29, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Simplified personas built as fictional characters with broad pain points are outdated in the future of search. </p>
<p>Think “Curious Cathy,” who just wants to learn more about your product, or “Technical Tom,” who has years of experience in his field and can handle more detailed breakdowns.</p>
<p>Static personas once helped, but they no longer reveal enough about real people to stay competitive.</p>
AI is getting better at understanding people – their needs, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a>, and intent.
<p>As search becomes more personalized, so should your personas.</p>
By layering in real-world <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> – like location, industry trends, or other environmental factors – you can create personas that reflect the actual people behind the queries. 
This richer <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> makes your content more relevant and increases the chances that AI will surface it when your audience is searching.
<p>Personas for SEO have always been how we attempt to define user intent. They cover:</p>
<p>But some personas are created only through the lens of a specific product, limiting our understanding of the people behind the queries.</p>
Take a look at this hypothetical, simple persona of a small <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> owner. 
<p>This persona structure is still helpful, especially for user journey mapping. </p>
It gives you clues on tone, style, and even which questions to answer for Small <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> Sara.
<p>That’s a strong start. But in the AI-powered search landscape, tone and topics aren’t enough.</p>
<p>High-level and simplified persona models miss that your target customer is more than just your target customer. </p>
They are living, breathing people, all influenced by outside factors that need to be considered when tailoring <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> to their needs.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> on Sara’s environment and what makes her a real human is missing.
<p>You don’t know what’s going on in Sara’s world that could be influencing her intent, needs, and decision-making process when she types in a query.</p>
<p>When crafting our personas, ideally, we would:</p>
<p>Most of us lack the time, budget, or resources to do this, though, leaving us with a knowledge gap we still need to fill.</p>
If you gathered small <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> owners from similar industries and asked them to list the steps they took to start, you’d probably get similar answers.
If you think about it from a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a>ual perspective only, sure.
<p>But if you listen more closely, you’ll likely notice a difference in the order they did things and what answers they found valuable at each stage.</p>
And this order, likely influenced by their environment, impacts what they do and don’t know when they land on the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> you assumed would fit their journey.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">environmental</a> factors are going to be complex and difficult to capture in their entirety. 
Let’s explore just how one piece of additional <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> can provide a little more insight that you might be able to leverage.
Someone in Florida, which has the highest per-capita rate of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> owners, will have different needs behind the query “how to start a business” than someone in West Virginia, where that rate is the lowest.
A person in Florida is statistically more likely to know someone who’s started a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>, giving them easier access to information and inspiration. 
In 2024, there were just over three <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> applications per 100 adult residents, according to Census data.
In West Virginia, where there was only one new <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> application per 100 adults, the story is different. 
A <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> owner there may have some personal connections, but starting a business is a more novel, less familiar path.
They’re more likely to need guidance on the fundamentals, like <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> plans and logistics.
While both Saras may search “how to start a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>,” what they need from that query isn’t the same. 
<p>Same question, different needs.</p>
<p>You can’t capture every detail shaping a person’s intent.</p>
Still, even a simple environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> like this can help you interpret it more accurately – and build personas that feel more human.
Here’s how the intent behind the keyword shifts based on this <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">environmental</a> knowledge:
You can argue that you have the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> that ultimately fits both of these intents. 
But is that content ranking for “how to start a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>”? Or is it featured in LLM responses or AI Overviews? 
I know my related <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> isn’t. 
It’s ranking for “how to write a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> plan” and “steps to getting an LLC,” because SEO until now has been about mastering a query, not tailoring your content to a user’s environment.
In my “deprecated” SEO strategy, I have a pillar page for “how to start a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>” that covers everything from business conception to making your first sale. 
<p>I’ve got dozens of internal links with beautiful anchor text to every supplemental guide Sara needs. Google loves it. </p>
This is where my traditional approach to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> needs improvement. 
<p>While it’s written for what I consider to be the user, it’s still focused on being thorough enough that Google puts me at the top, and not considering other outside factors that might influence search needs.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
If you doubt that location changes the needs behind ‘how to start a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>,’ compare prompts with and without location in incognito chat.
<p>Now, take a look at how it changes when I say I live in Florida.</p>
It’s a subtle difference, but when you say you live in West Virginia, ChatGPT suggested clarifying your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> idea and proper planning as the first step. 
In Florida, it dives right into <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> structure. 
While AI doesn’t already have everyone’s environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> in memory, when the user includes context in prompts, ChatGPT attempts to adjust its response. 
Assuming everyone searching for “how to start a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>” is looking for the same info might let you rank in a traditional blue-link search result.
However, this example shows that this shift to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a>-driven prompts influences how AI generates a response. 
This is just one data point. A full strategy needs deeper environmental context than <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> applications or economic stats alone.
<p>AI search – whether through AI Overviews or LLMs – is built to reduce the cognitive overload of digging through multiple articles, clicks, and follow-up searches. </p>
It leverages user <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> to deliver a succinct, relevant answer.
<p>Take the earlier example: you could create 51 articles for every state and Washington, D.C. </p>
In traditional search, that might help you rank for “how to start a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> in (state).” 
I’ve done this – customizing each article with state-specific agencies and forms – but without weaving in the deeper <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> of what’s happening in those states.
<p>Both matter – they just reward different optimizations.</p>
<p>The goal isn’t to overhaul your entire strategy overnight. </p>
Start testing ways to incorporate more <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> over time. Revisit your core content and weave in focused examples or localized insights. 
<p>Not every topic needs a “personalized” version.</p>
Instead, find places where you can speak to your audience more directly, whether through localized callouts, customer-focused CTAs, or targeted subsections within existing <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a>.
<p>With clicks declining across the board, optimizing for conversion when you do get traffic is critical to proving the value of search. </p>
Even if you’re focused on just one “Sara,” you still need to understand which end of the spectrum you’re targeting – and adjust your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> to meet that audience where they are in the moment.
Digging deeper into environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> helps you prioritize information gain – the key to becoming the most valuable answer a platform can surface. 
<p>The more clearly you understand who you’re creating for, the better positioned you are to deliver that value.</p>
Environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> isn’t the only input that matters. It’s one piece of a holistic persona-building approach. 
The real advantage comes from layering these insights with conversion <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>, click and impression metrics, rankings, LLM visibility, and referrals. 
Environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> is simply one more tool in a stronger, more adaptive strategy.
Hopefully, your personas are already rooted in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>.
But what kind of SEO would I be if I didn’t ask for more <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>?
Adding environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> from third-party sources helps you stand out, prioritize opportunities, and reach the right people at the right time. 
It’s most powerful when combined with multiple <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> sources, environmental factors, and qualitative insights.
<p>Digging into every persona or segment at once can be overwhelming. </p>
Focus on small, incremental adjustments for long-term gains, not a full <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> overhaul.
<p>The suggestions below are meant to show you where to start – not to imply you need to do it all at once. </p>
The data you need to understand environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> rarely lives in-house. 
<p>Your BI team can share valuable insights on where you’re winning or growing, but external sources will help you transform personas into richer, more actionable profiles.</p>
<p>First, make sure your base persona includes core demographics such as:</p>
If you’re missing these basics, start with publicly available <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> like the U.S. Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), or Statista.
For example, in the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>-owner scenario, I used Business Formation Statistics from the Census and population estimates.
The Census Annual <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a> Survey program also provides insights like:
The BLS can help you see which states are experiencing growth in new <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">business</a>es, while Census tables provide demographic breakdowns for those states. 
<p>And if you know your target industry, Labor Force statistics can help you understand the age ranges most active in that space.</p>
While this example focused on location as an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">environmental</a> factor, age alone is another strong starting point. 
<p>There’s ample research on what each generation values, fears, and prioritizes at different stages of their careers.</p>
Here’s a list of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">environmental</a> questions you can aim to answer and how that might inform your strategy:
<p>If you’re already a power creator – or have the budget – paid tools like Semrush, SimilarWeb, or Kantar can deliver deep audience insights.</p>
If not, free sources like Census <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> Tools, BLS tables, and some old-fashioned desktop research are still excellent for uncovering the data you need to better understand your audience.
Combine internal <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> with public sources to identify your top demographics and refine user journey mapping. 
Environmental research helps you tailor <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> to real needs instead of covering everything broadly. 
<p>When layered with behavioral signals, technical SEO, and testing, these insights multiply visibility and conversions.</p>
Marketers may not master the human mind, but we excel at interpreting <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>. 
Apply that skill to strategy: focus on <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a>, clarity, and information gain so your content becomes the answer AI and users trust.
Strong technical fundamentals still drive rankings, but environmental <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">context</a> boosts your chances of surfacing in AI responses. 
<p>Amid all the AI hype, the cornerstone of search is still the person behind the persona.</p>
