<p>Published on September 02, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Generative engine optimization (GEO) is the new kid on the block, the hot topic. </p>
<p>SEO professionals and stakeholders want to know: How much should I invest in it in a world where the people writing the checks are a bit skeptical? </p>
<p>In the world of large language models (LLMs) in 2025, that’s a complicated question. </p>
<p>This article breaks down why by covering:</p>
<p>One of the fundamental challenges for the creators of LLMs (LLMs) like OpenAI or Claude is timeliness.</p>
<p>Their training data is static, locked to a specific cutoff date. </p>
<p>For example, the GPT-5 model’s knowledge cutoff is Sept. 30, 2024.</p>
<p>It’s more recent than GPT-4o’s cutoff of Oct. 1, 2023, but still not up to the present day.</p>
<p>Updating that training data is extremely costly, and it’s increasingly under public scrutiny – both for the resource-intensive nature of the process and the potential copyright issues it raises. </p>
<p>In my view, these large-scale training updates are becoming less and less likely over time.</p>
<p>So how do OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini keep their answers current? </p>
<p>They use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model enriches its responses by effectively “browsing” the web. ChatGPT relies on Bing, while Gemini draws from Google. </p>
<p>(There are signs Gemini doesn’t always use live results, but rather cached ones – that’s a whole other article, and one Dan Petrovic has already written smartly about.)</p>
<p>Grounding is a similar concept here, so for this article, we’ll treat it as the same “timely” method, even though there are important nuances in implementation.</p>
<p>What does this mean for SEOs and digital marketers deciding how much to invest in GEO?</p>
<p>Quite simply: we still need to prioritize traditional SEO first. RAG is a limited resource, and research shows: </p>
<p>It’s also important to note: when ChatGPT cites your brand, it doesn’t just pull from your website. It pulls from sources across the web.</p>
<p>The bottom line: you still need to master traditional SEO fundamentals to rank in LLM-driven search. </p>
<p>If you don’t have the authority to break into the Top 20 results, plus a diversified outreach strategy for press mentions and brand visibility, it will be much harder to surface in generative search.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: SEO vs. GEO: What’s different? What’s the same?</p>
<p>As a low-risk, forward-looking, brand-focused SEO, you must plan for a future where generative search dominates, driving most traffic and revenue.</p>
<p>At that point, we must assume our websites and digital properties function primarily as enriched data feeds for LLMs. </p>
<p>It’s also critical to clearly define our brand for both Google and Bing, as strong, unambiguous entity signals will only grow in importance.</p>
<p>Optimizing your data infrastructure and strengthening brand signals – through consistent press mentions, directory listings, and owned media – are essential but resource-intensive tasks. </p>
<p>They demand coordination across departments that rarely collaborate and often require dismantling entrenched processes.</p>
<p>Because many businesses hesitate to make these foundational changes, you’ll need to account for the time required to execute the work and the time required to gain stakeholder alignment.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>The work required to make your website as LLM-friendly as possible falls into two main buckets: technical and brand.</p>
<p>Implementing thorough schema markup</p>
<p>This is a contentious topic. </p>
<p>LLMs don’t directly use schema markup in their training data (it’s stripped), and in their RAG process, everything is tokenized and likely broken into n-grams. </p>
<p>I’m not suggesting schema markup is a direct way to influence visibility in LLMs.</p>
<p>It’s a vehicle for helping Google and Bing understand:</p>
<p>This builds your brand and search engines’ recognition of it, which should improve your visibility in results.</p>
<p>Technical copywriting</p>
<p>On navigational pages – like product collection pages or company listing pages if you’re a marketplace – create technical copy (done via AI with smart prompting if you’re working at scale) that summarizes the available resources.</p>
<p>Notice how direct and technical this is. The clear formatting ties back to dependency hops in natural language processing.</p>
<p>A spring cleaning task. </p>
<p>Your XML feeds should be 100% to spec:</p>
<p>I’m calling it out specifically because it’s one of the most direct ways for search engines and other bots to see and navigate the full scope of your website.</p>
<p>JavaScript fallbacks</p>
<p>This has always been important but has fallen by the wayside in recent years. </p>
<p>Training data for LLMs is static HTML. For the most part, they don’t render JavaScript. </p>
<p>Make sure to have functional JavaScript fallbacks.</p>
<p>Address technical debt</p>
<p>This will depend on your organization. It could mean:</p>
<p>All of these impact performance.</p>
<p>The technical strength and response time of your website will only grow more important.</p>
<p>Every piece of tech debt is an opportunity to improve.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: A technical SEO blueprint for GEO: Optimize for AI-powered search</p>
<p>Brand tasks would include things like: </p>
<p>Dig deeper: In GEO, brand mentions do what links alone can’t</p>
<p>If there’s only one takeaway, it’s this: keep investing the majority of your time and budget in traditional SEO, while dedicating a smaller portion to technical and brand tasks like those outlined above.</p>
<p>Look closely at the 1-5% improvements you’ve been putting off – things like:</p>
<p>This “spring cleaning” and tech debt cleanup should be a priority. </p>
<p>Add in the brand work as well, since it strengthens traditional search today and also lays the groundwork for an LLM-led search future.</p>
<p>If you don’t already have regular reporting in place for stakeholders and leadership, create it now. </p>
<p>There’s a perception that large language models are evolving rapidly and changing everything at once. </p>
<p>That isn’t entirely true – but we do need to plan. </p>
<p>Establishing a cadence of reporting and education means that when real shifts do happen, your stakeholders will already be aligned and ready to support the work.</p>
<p>Finally, treat GEO/AI optimization as roughly 20% work. </p>
<p>This means building systemic schema layers across your organization and creating structured connections in the machine’s native language – code. </p>
<p>Done properly, this work should have no negative impact on your business metrics, and it builds support for more holistic optimization over time.</p>
<p>Going all in on LLM-specific tactics isn’t the best use of your resources today. </p>
<p>Instead, treat it as complementary work – something that strengthens your technical and brand foundation while preparing you for a future where generative search plays a central role.</p>
