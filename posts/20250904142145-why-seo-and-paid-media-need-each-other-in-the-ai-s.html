<p>AI search is rewriting the rules of visibility. </p>
<p>Google’s AI Overviews aren’t just another rich result or algorithm update.</p>
<p>They are cutting into clicks, pushing ads into unpredictable spots, and leaving both SEO and PPC teams with incomplete data.Success now depends on breaking down silos:</p>
<p>Many brands are already seeing drops in paid CTRs, Quality Scores, and clicks across terms that once performed well.</p>
<p>Even though ads are now showing in AI Overviews, Google Ads doesn’t provide a clear way to track them. </p>
<p>Just as SEOs can’t see performance for these results in Google Search Console, PPC marketers are also blind to placement data.</p>
<p>Here’s how the gaps show up for paid search teams today:</p>
<p>With visibility this limited, SEOs have an opportunity to step in and add value. </p>
<p>By sharing what we’re seeing in the SERPs, we can help paid media teams make smarter decisions, faster.</p>
<p>AI Overviews are hurting clicks, especially from top-of-funnel queries. </p>
<p>Featured snippets and zero-click results were the warm-up. </p>
<p>Now, we’ve entered a new reality where sometimes it feels like the entire first page of Google is condensed into AI-generated summaries.</p>
<p>You’ll even spot People also ask answers generated as AI Overviews.</p>
<p>It’s not just SEO that’s evolving. </p>
<p>AI Overviews are changing paid search too, and giving SEOs a bigger role in supporting and amplifying campaign performance.</p>
<p>We’re seeing this shift echoed across the industry, too.</p>
<p>This kind of collaboration isn’t a nice-to-have anymore. </p>
<p>It’s table stakes for success in our new AI-dominated landscape.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>AI Overviews are blurring the lines between organic, paid, and AI search results. </p>
<p>The best SEOs are already helping PPC teams:</p>
<p>Not all keywords trigger AI Overviews yet. But for the ones that do, your paid team needs to know.</p>
<p>Offer to set up a tagged keyword list in your keyword tracking tool of choice (e.g., Semrush, Ubersuggest, Ahrefs) where you track the most important keywords in your paid campaigns.</p>
<p>The sooner you set this up, the better, as it can be tedious to backfill AI Overviews visibility for untracked/untagged keywords.</p>
<p>Start flagging which terms are generating AI overviews, and what the brand’s visibility looks like against competitors. </p>
<p>Sure, tracking all of your paid keywords might mean a small added cost, but these insights can help paid media teams:</p>
<p>To maximize the impact of earned and paid in AI search, Cassandra Gucwa, founder and CEO of Menerva Digital, explains: </p>
<p>More than quick answers, AI Overviews are curated summaries built to feel useful, and users are starting to trust how they read. That’s a signal. </p>
<p>It tells you exactly how to write ad copy that feels relevant and helpful in the same moment.</p>
<p>Think of AI Overviews as free market research, or a live feed of what Google thinks users want to see. Watch for:</p>
<p>Now, use those insights and start testing ad copy that mirrors what’s already winning Google shelf space. </p>
<p>If AI Overviews surface phrases like “fast acting,” “top rated,” or “budget friendly,” your ads may perform better if you echo that tone.</p>
<p>Google is making it easier than ever for users to get answers without clicking, and that trend is not going away anytime soon.</p>
<p>SEO teams have access to a wealth of helpful data from tools like Google Search Console and keyword tracking tools.</p>
<p>We should also flag keywords that aren’t consistently triggering AI Overviews, as that can help paid media teams focus on those potentially higher-impact keyword opportunities.</p>
<p>With all of these organic insights, paid media teams can consider if they want to test:</p>
<p>This kind of data sharing fuels better testing and a smarter search strategy on both paid and organic.</p>
<p>One of the biggest missed opportunities in SEO and paid media collaboration is competitive intelligence.</p>
<p>SEO teams are already monitoring the SERPs, sometimes daily, and can help paid media teams spot brand mentions, shifts in content types, and new players faster. </p>
<p>Watch for patterns with top competitors and new brands that weren’t on your radar before, as well as the different types of content and user intents being met.</p>
<p>Use this data to:</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this type of competitive intelligence isn’t just helpful for AI Overviews.</p>
<p>These days, SEO teams are monitoring AI visibility by topic across platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and more.</p>
<p>I’ve seen AI visibility insights introduce brand new competitors to teams, and give them a totally new way to think about their competitive disadvantages.</p>
<p>AI search is shaking up our paid and organic playbooks and giving us a new, exciting edge.</p>
<p>SEOs have access to real-time SERP shifts, AI copy trends, and competitive visibility insights. Paid media teams have the agility and data to act fast and capitalize on those trends.</p>
<p>Together, SEO and paid media teams can build smarter strategies that thrive in an AI-dominated landscape.</p>
