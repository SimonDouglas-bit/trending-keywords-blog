<p>Published on September 08, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Over the past two years, AI and LLMs have stepped out of the shadows and into public consciousness. </p>
<p>Not long ago, most people’s understanding of AI was limited to sci-fi references or the occasional nightmare about machines taking over.</p>
<p>Now, everyone seems to be talking about it – and naturally, marketers have jumped right in. </p>
<p>We did it with search engines. We tried it with social media. </p>
<p>And now we’re doing it again with LLMs, using emerging technology and growing public interest to promote our brands.</p>
<p>Conferences are dedicated to finding the silver bullet of AI optimization. LinkedIn is overflowing with think pieces. </p>
<p>We’ve nearly agreed on an acronym. And marketing job postings already list it as a must-have skill.</p>
<p>But what about the future of “GEO”? </p>
<p>Will it grow into a critical channel with its own specialists, or will it settle into a niche within SEO like so many other skill sets before it?</p>
<p>There are reasons why we might expect GEO to develop into its own marketing discipline.</p>
<p>The core reason GEO could become its own specialization is if we, as an industry, make it so. </p>
<p>There is already significant discussion around GEO within the SEO community, from trying to pick the right acronym to defending its importance among other marketing channels. </p>
<p>One way it may become its own discipline is through sheer force of will. </p>
<p>The more we label it as distinct from SEO, the more it will be seen as a standalone channel.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Yes, GEO is happening</p>
<p>We may also see a major shift in how LLMs operate. </p>
<p>Right now, GEO feels very similar to SEO at a strategic level, with differences mainly in tactics. </p>
<p>Both focus on optimizing for discovery across platforms. </p>
<p>But if LLMs evolve beyond the current question-and-answer model – or if agentic AI becomes the real focus of GEO – our tactics may need to change significantly, requiring an entirely new strategic approach. </p>
<p>At that point, the platforms themselves would have diverged enough for GEO to be treated as its own discipline.</p>
<p>Another reason GEO might separate from SEO is if it becomes less about optimizing for algorithms and more about partnerships with LLM providers.</p>
<p>For example, Perplexity AI has formed partnerships with media companies, using their data sets in its knowledge base so customers can interact with participating brands directly through answers. </p>
<p>If this trend grows, optimizing for visibility may look less like SEO and more like affiliate or partnership marketing.</p>
<p>Finally, GEO could surpass SEO in overall value. </p>
<p>If LLMs become the primary source of discovery, GEO skills will be in higher demand. </p>
<p>In that case, many SEO specialists may simply rebrand themselves as GEO specialists. </p>
<p>Rather than being just a niche channel, GEO could become the default search discovery channel.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: SEO vs. GEO: What’s different? What’s the same?</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>While there are many reasons why GEO could become its own specialization, there are also important reasons why it may not.</p>
<p>Right now, the skills needed to optimize for visibility in LLMs are very similar to those of SEO.</p>
<p>The main difference lies in understanding how LLMs function and how people use them.</p>
<p>But these aren’t fundamentally new skills. </p>
<p>SEOs already spend hours:</p>
<p>The platforms may operate differently at a technical level, and their inner workings aren’t as straightforward as some assume. </p>
<p>Still, the expertise required to succeed with LLMs overlaps heavily with SEO.</p>
<p>Another reason GEO might not split from SEO is if there simply isn’t enough revenue or measurable value to justify a dedicated specialization. </p>
<p>Right now, LLMs drive very little traffic to websites, and the true impact of visibility in these platforms is difficult to track. </p>
<p>Unless GEO begins to replace the value currently generated by SEO, the case for a standalone focus remains weak.</p>
<p>LLMs will likely be further monetized, most likely through paid partnerships or pay-per-click (PPC) and pay-per-impression models. </p>
<p>If that happens, these opportunities will fit neatly within the existing skills of digital marketers. </p>
<p>Paid GEO would simply become part of established advertising practices, not an entirely new discipline. </p>
<p>Similarly, there’s no real reason to expect a need for specialists in organic LLM optimization.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Will GEO replace SEO – or become part of it?</p>
<p>Honestly, I think the most likely outcome lies somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Most plausibly, GEO will end up as a sub-specialty rather than a standalone discipline. </p>
<p>Think of local SEO or YouTube SEO. These aren’t fields that someone practices exclusively. </p>
<p>Instead, they tend to be areas of focus for people who enjoy the nuances or have gained significant experience in them, but they’re rarely the sole focus of a role.</p>
<p>It’s uncommon to see a job posting for a “YouTube optimizer” with no other requirements. </p>
<p>Even roles that specify “local SEO” typically expect strong generalist SEO knowledge alongside it. </p>
<p>Similarly, it’s hard to imagine a company hiring one person to handle SEO and another to handle only GEO. </p>
<p>The overlap is just too great.</p>
<p>More likely, once the current hype around AI optimization fades, search professionals will fold GEO into their existing responsibilities. </p>
<p>Right now, many people are positioning themselves as GEO experts, often trying to stake out something revolutionary (and sometimes deliberately contrary) to gain attention. </p>
<p>But this isn’t new. </p>
<p>Not long ago, the buzz was around TikTok as the “next frontier” of SEO. </p>
<p>LinkedIn was full of think pieces about social media becoming Gen Z’s search platform. </p>
<p>That didn’t materialize in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>When the next shiny thing arrives, GEO and SEO will likely become two sides of the same coin – simply part of a broader practice of search optimization.</p>
