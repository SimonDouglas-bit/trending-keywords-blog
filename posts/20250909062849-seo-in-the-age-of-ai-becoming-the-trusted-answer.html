<p>Published on September 05, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>For years, I’ve updated my working definition of SEO to capture how the discipline has evolved. </p>
<p>Here’s how those definitions have changed over time:</p>
<p>This redefinition raises an essential question: if SEO has converged into educating AI assistive engines, where should we look to understand how these systems learn?</p>
<p>Although Google may seem to be losing ground in online search and research, it remains the best ecosystem for understanding where AI assistive engines are heading.</p>
<p>Because it’s the only major player with all three pillars of the algorithmic trinity: </p>
<p>Our role is to create clarity. </p>
<p>Think of AI as a child – eager to please, but easily confused. </p>
<p>It learns from your digital footprint and forms its answers, recommendations, and suggestions through three lenses: </p>
<p>The curriculum to teach is threefold: conversation, knowledge, and up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Generative AI is changing search, but Google is still where people start: Study</p>
<p>To succeed in this new paradigm, brands need a structured, repeatable methodology. </p>
<p>Traditional, channel-specific tactics won’t hold up because AI learns from the entire digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>This methodology rests on three sequential pillars:</p>
<p>Together, these three phases build a consistent digital presence that:</p>
<p>Every day, AI assistive engines like Google AI Mode, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Copilot have trillions of niche conversations with billions of people who trust them. </p>
<p>These engines now cover every stage of the Conversational Acquisition Funnel – explicit, implicit, and ambient research – and every prospect will engage with their version of your funnel at some point.</p>
<p>Your job is to win at every stage by being top of algorithmic mind, whichever engine your ideal prospect prefers.</p>
<p>At the awareness stage, how does a new client discover you?</p>
<p>Google’s recent cleanup of ambiguous thing entities shows that AI assistive engines are unlikely to introduce a vaguely defined concept into a specific conversation. They prefer a recognized expert.</p>
<p>To become the clear answer here, you must provide relevant content in the right format and be the trusted entity on a specific topic (topical authority). </p>
<p>When AI is confident in your expertise and you feed it the content it needs, it will prioritize your solution – and advocate for you at the top of the funnel. </p>
<p>Awareness is the deliverability phase.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>At the consideration stage, Google’s focus on unifying person entities is telling. </p>
<p>When a user is evaluating options, AI is asking: </p>
<p>An entity with a confused or multi-typed classification is at a disadvantage. It lacks the clear authority to be presented as a trustworthy option. </p>
<p>To earn the recommendation here, AI must have absolute confidence in your credibility, earned through a clearly defined entity and reinforced by undeniable N-E-E-A-T-T signals. </p>
<p>Consideration is the credibility phase.</p>
<p>At the decision stage, the stakes are highest – the perfect (money) click.</p>
<p>When a potential client asks, “Who should I choose?” you need to be firmly established as the ultimate choice.</p>
<p>To be the trusted choice at this stage, your brand must be factually and consistently defined across the web. </p>
<p>That clarity allows AI to confidently present you as the solution – reinforced with a trust-building summary and a direct link to the money page.</p>
<p>Decision is the understandability phase.</p>
<p>Google’s June 2025 Knowledge Graph update was a call to arms for clarity – and it changes our job description. </p>
<p>Our role is no longer about persuading algorithms with tactics, but about fundamentally educating them.</p>
<p>This is the greatest opportunity since Google won the search engine wars, when we could finally focus on one engine instead of half a dozen. </p>
<p>Today, brands that embrace their role as teachers will build a deep, resilient moat of algorithmic trust.</p>
<p>Those brands will stay top of the algorithmic mind – and the ones AI engines confidently recommend again and again.</p>
