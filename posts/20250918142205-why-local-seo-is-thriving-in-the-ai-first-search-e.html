<p>Published on September 17, 2025</p>

<p>Generative AI is changing how users search. With instant answers from AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and other tools, many searchers no longer need to click through to websites – especially for informational queries. </p>
<p>But this change has resulted in many websites seeing declining click-through rates despite rising impressions.</p>
<p>However, there’s a notable exception: local search. </p>
<p>Businesses that depend on local intent are seeing steady performance, with no signs of the “alligator graph” (rising impressions and falling clicks) that plagues other categories.</p>
<p>This article explains why local content is uniquely resilient in the age of generative AI – and how you can capitalize on this by strengthening your local SEO efforts.</p>
<p>Try searching [pizza near me] in ChatGPT or another AI platform. </p>
<p>The results are vague, lack images, and often list places that aren’t even nearby. </p>
<p>There are no maps, no phone numbers, and no real-time context.</p>
<p>By contrast, search the same query in Google Maps.</p>
<p>You get a rich, visual interface with accurate listings, reviews, directions, call buttons, and real-time location tracking.</p>
<p>AI tools don’t offer a comparable user experience for local discovery. Why?</p>
<p>Generative AI doesn’t know where you’re searching from – at least not without you telling it explicitly. That lack of geolocation leads to generic, irrelevant answers. </p>
<p>For local search, proximity is a key ranking factor, so this is a critical weakness.</p>
<p>While privacy advocates may welcome the anonymity, users looking for nearby services don’t benefit from extra friction. </p>
<p>Most searchers won’t bother entering their exact address just to get AI-powered suggestions. As a result, traditional search still wins for queries with clear local intent.</p>
<p>Even if AI tools eventually solve for location accuracy, they still face another barrier.</p>
<p>Local searches often lead to phone calls, in-person visits, or service appointments—not just website clicks. Users want to talk to someone who can fix their roof, unclog a pipe, or deliver a pizza. AI can explain how to do these things, but it can’t actually do them.</p>
<p>This is why Google rarely includes AI Overviews in local search results. In fact, AI Overviews are less likely to appear for local queries than for informational ones, a recent Ahrefs study found.</p>
<p>Even when AI attempts to answer, it leans heavily on the same sources traditional local SEO relies on.</p>
<p>Ask Perplexity or ChatGPT for a local service provider and you’ll often get:</p>
<p>These models don’t generate original local knowledge. They aggregate and summarize structured data from platforms like Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and others.</p>
<p>As Lily Ray noted in a recent analysis, Google’s AI Mode cites links to Google Business Profiles much more frequently than linking to external websites.</p>
<p>This means all the work on local listings, location pages, and service area pages will continue, even if users decide to switch search platforms.</p>
<p>In short, all the local SEO fundamentals – reviews, directory listings, business profile accuracy – still matter. Arguably, they matter even more in the AI era.</p>
<p>As search behavior evolves across platforms, it’s more important than ever for businesses to be discoverable everywhere. </p>
<p>This is the foundation of Search Everywhere Optimization.</p>
<p>Local SEO has always embraced this mindset. Success means showing up across a wide network of data aggregators, map apps, industry-specific directories, and review platforms. </p>
<p>These touchpoints are exactly where AI tools look for signals.</p>
<p>If your local business is consistently represented across these platforms, you’re already aligned with how AI gathers and validates information.</p>
<p>To maintain and grow local visibility, prioritize these tactical steps:</p>
<p>Local SEO isn’t just surviving the generative AI shift – it’s thriving. Investing in visibility across platforms, accurate business data, and review generation will remain discoverable no matter how the search landscape evolves.</p>
