<p>As SERPs continue to change, we see more search features taking up space on Page 1. </p>
<p>That’s why it’s increasingly important to gain visibility in People Also Ask results. </p>
<p>Let’s go over some ways to research People Also Ask (PAA) rankings, and methods you can use in order to get a website ranking in them.</p>
<p>This accordioned box shows a list of questions related to the query that you searched. </p>
<p>You can expand the accordions to find out more information and click through to different links. </p>
<p>In some cases, AI Overviews results can appear within an expanded PAA box. See below:</p>
<p>So, if you have a shoe company but are having a hard time ranking on Page 1 for the query “types of shoes” (8,100 monthly search volume according to Semrush), you still have the opportunity to optimize a page for related queries and show up in the SERPs. </p>
<p>Or, if you’re already in the top spot for the query but want to dominate that SERP as much as possible, you can also try to get another page ranked in the PAA box.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Google generates nearly 13% of People Also Ask answers: Data</p>
<p>Drill down into specific PAA rankings with Semrush’s SERP Features tool (or a comparable keyword tool).</p>
<p>Just pop your domain into Domain Overview, and navigate to Organic Research. From there, drill down in a few different ways:</p>
<p>All of these views can be helpful in some way. </p>
<p>Identifying where your site ranks but doesn’t appear in the PAA box lets you build a list of content and optimization opportunities to boost visibility.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>This can get a little time-consuming, since the keyword that your site is ranking for in the PAA box is not the same keyword being shown in Semrush. (Remember, it’s a related question that people also ask). </p>
<p>Dig into the different related questions by viewing the SERPs in Semrush. </p>
<p>For example, Nike ranks well for the keyword “Jordan 4” but doesn’t rank in the PAA result on that SERP. </p>
<p>If we view the SERP for that keyword…</p>
<p>…then we can see what questions are appearing. </p>
<p>“How do I spot fake Air Jordans” and “What is the rarest J4” present good opportunities to create content that answers those questions directly on the Nike site.</p>
<p>Tackle these opportunities in a few ways:</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Case study: How to get rid of a negative ‘People also ask’ result</p>
<p>Short answer: Answer the questions that people also ask. </p>
<p>From the research you pull, choose the related questions that are relevant to your brand, products and/or services. </p>
<p>Then, create some informative, concise FAQs on relevant pages (or create new pages as needed). </p>
<p>Quality and informative content that your site has the right to win for is going to perform best in these results. </p>
<p>You’ll want to wrap the question headings in H2 or H3 tags and then include the answer as a small paragraph below. </p>
<p>Don’t forget about authority.</p>
<p>As a supporting tactic, you’ll want to ensure that Google sees your site and important pages as authoritative. </p>
<p>Find natural ways to gain links from high domain authority sites, whether that’s from gaining news coverage or having a thought leader do an interview for a publication. </p>
<p>Especially when creating a new page, you’ll want to try to gain some backlinks to it.</p>
<p>And ensure your internal linking profile is strong. Linking to pages where you’re answering PAA questions can help signal their importance to Google.</p>
<p>Steer clear of these common mistakes to keep your content eligible and effective in PAA boxes:</p>
<p>Include your target PAA keywords in your rank tracking tool to see when you’ve won those spots.</p>
<p>In Semrush, check the SERP Features trend and filter for PAA results to track how many you rank for over time and spot any major changes.</p>
<p>The People Also Ask box is a powerful gateway to visibility, authority, and long-tail traffic. </p>
<p>By delivering concise, intent-driven answers and tracking your performance, you can secure a lasting presence in these results and extend your brand’s reach beyond traditional rankings. </p>
<p>As search evolves – and with AI and conversational queries on the rise – PAA results will only grow in importance. </p>
<p>Make PAA optimization a core part of your strategy now by researching questions, structuring answers, and tracking your wins.</p>
