<p>Published on September 26, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Content has long been the fuel for SEO, and its importance continues as AI-driven search relies on rich, trustworthy information. </p>
<p>I’ve always believed in doing the “good” and “right” things when it comes to creating content at scale – but even good things can become problems when overdone.</p>
<p>Too often, SEO and AI visibility efforts get reduced to publishing more blogs, landing pages, or articles in the pursuit of quick wins that executives want to see. </p>
<p>While content is critical, treating SEO as a production machine creates the illusion of progress.</p>
<p>Activity without performance bloats sites with duplicative, commoditized, or low-value pages that both search engines and customers overlook. </p>
<p>Real results come when content is balanced with technical SEO, authority building, and alignment to business goals, not when output becomes the strategy itself.</p>
<p>Breaking free from a content-only mindset means broadening how we define SEO success. </p>
<p>The following areas show where to shift focus and rebalance your strategy.</p>
<p>Use audits – whether with third-party crawlers, AI tools, or manual reviews – to surface low-value content. </p>
<p>If your objectives are tied too heavily to content, are vague or incomplete, or are linked only to tactics rather than a robust, leading – not trailing – strategy, they’re due for a reset. </p>
<p>Step one is to revisit your overarching SEO and visibility goals. </p>
<p>Then connect those goals directly to your content strategy – focusing on quality over volume – and map each piece to a funnel stage, customer journey touchpoint, or specific ROI metric.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to blend AI and human input in your content approach</p>
<p>When content dominates your SEO strategy, it’s easy to overlook the technical factors that determine visibility. </p>
<p>On-page optimization may help, but without attention to site health and user experience, your content may never reach its full potential.</p>
<p>Crawling and indexing have always been core to SEO, and they remain critical for both search engines and LLMs. </p>
<p>If your content can’t be properly discovered and sourced, it won’t surface for your audience – regardless of quality. </p>
<p>Beyond that, factors like page experience and rendering influence how your site is ranked and, more importantly, how visitors interact with it. </p>
<p>Poor UX can drive users back to search results, undermining the very visibility you’re working to achieve.</p>
<p>I’ve long said, “great content attracts great links.” </p>
<p>That phrase nods to the early days of SEO, and while simplified, it still holds true. </p>
<p>The problem is that content alone often creates an “if you build it, they will come” mentality – one that leaves deserved visibility and engagement on the table.</p>
<p>Earning backlinks, PR, mentions, and other third-party validation remains vital for both search and LLMs.</p>
<p>Leaving these signals out of your planning means missing a key dimension of optimization. </p>
<p>Authority building should be integrated into your SEO and content strategy to add purpose and extend the impact of what you publish.</p>

<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>You can follow agile methodology or use different terminology and approaches, but the key is to define the time periods and milestones that matter. </p>
<p>Day-to-day distractions and the habit of piling new tasks onto existing efforts blur where one initiative ends and another begins. </p>
<p>Combined with the shifting environment of attribution and measurement, it becomes difficult to set clear starting and stopping points in SEO and AI optimization.</p>
<p>When content is the main focus, the instinct is often to do more when results fall short. A sprint model helps break that pattern. </p>
<p>By planning efforts in defined cycles, you can measure outcomes objectively and conduct retrospectives. </p>
<p>Those insights then help you realign your overall and content strategies, bringing a more data-driven, disciplined approach to each next phase.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to create content that works for search and generative engines</p>
<p>When I hear about a company’s content strategy, the first questions I ask are: </p>
<p>Sometimes the cadence exists because it’s what the company has always done. Other times, it traces back to a best practices recommendation.</p>
<p>I don’t approach those conversations with a fixed cadence of my own, or with the intent to blow up what’s working. </p>
<p>In many cases, the timing and tactics are sound.</p>
<p>The problem comes when we stop asking questions. Without a regular, healthy review, it’s easy to slip into checklist mode.</p>
<p>Any marketing activity that becomes just another box to tick loses its sense of investment and expected return. </p>
<p>Instead of weighing the time, money, and opportunity costs against other options, we risk treating strategy like routine busywork.</p>
<p>At SMX West in early 2020 – just before the pandemic – I spoke about the benefits of aligning SEO and PPC. </p>
<p>What I couldn’t predict was how essential cross-functional integration would become in the era of AI.</p>
<p>Digital channels have always influenced each other, but AI raises the stakes. </p>
<p>Brand, UX, IT, search, social, and content all need to work together efficiently. </p>
<p>The same goes for marketing, sales, product, and leadership. </p>
<p>Integration prevents SEO and AI initiatives from being dismissed as “just marketing tasks.” </p>
<p>It ensures they connect to business-outcome-driven KPIs, new measurement models, and company-wide AI priorities.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: An AI-assisted content process that outperforms human-only copy</p>
<p>SEO has never been about content alone, and in the era of AI-driven search, it can’t afford to be reduced to a publishing treadmill. </p>
<p>Breaking free means balancing content with technical health, authority signals, agile planning, and cross-functional alignment. </p>
<p>By shifting from sheer output to intentional strategy, you avoid bloat, earn visibility where it matters, and position SEO as a driver of growth rather than just another box to check.</p>
