<p>The number of websites linking to this post.</p>
This post's estimated monthly organic <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> traffic.
User interactions, also called UX signals or user signals, include things like clicks, scrolls, swipes, and mouse hovers. These now play a major role in how Google ranks content and which brands gain more visibility in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> results.
Here’s everything you need to know about merging UX and SEO to win over <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a>ers and the algorithms and models that use their interactions as a data source.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>r interactions aren’t direct ranking factors. For instance, more clicks don’t automatically mean higher rankings.
But user experience still plays a critical role in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a>.
During the DOJ’s 2023 antitrust trial against Google, internal Google documents confirmed that user interaction data is one of the three core pillars of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a>.
The easiest way to think about it is as a data source. Every click, scroll, or bounce feeds back into <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> systems.
Every <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> is an intricate giving and receiving act between the searcher and the platform they’re using.
These user interaction signals don’t shift your rankings in real time, but they train learning-to-rank models—the machine learning frameworks <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines use to predict which results will satisfy future queries.
In other words, UX signals influence the long-term evolution of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> results.
When it comes to AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a>, the link is less direct. Your website’s UX doesn’t currently decide whether you’re cited in an AI response.
However, AI platforms already <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> interaction data within their platform to refine their models and personalize responses to users. It’s logical to assume that user engagement patterns may therefore influence which sources are trusted and surfaced more often over time.
In traditional and AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a>, the outcome of good UX comes down to the patterns machine learning models detect from user interactions. Their goal is to provide quality results that satisfy their users’ needs following a search.
<p>The websites that provide the best experience will be the ones that feature in future results.</p>
Bringing UX and SEO together is about designing pages that work for both humans and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines.
The two disciplines share the same end goal: helping people find and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> information effectively.
Below, we’ll walk through a step-by-step process that aligns strong UX principles with proven <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> practices, so your site can rank well and keep users engaged.
A solid information architecture is the foundation of every <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a>-friendly and user-friendly website. It’s how you plan, organize, and label your pages so they make sense to both people and search engines.
This step is integral to both <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> and UX design processes.
Unfortunately, most <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a>s treat this task as simply adding keywords to URLs, ignoring other elements like navigation and accessibility.
On the other hand, many designers neglect keywords altogether, making costly mistakes during redesigns when <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> performance is negatively affected.
<p>To do it right, you should incorporate the best practices of both disciplines:</p>
No matter whether you’re a designer or an SEO professional, keyword re<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> and topic mapping are the first things you should do when planning your information architecture.
Keywords are a form of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>r data.
You can <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> them to identify patterns in people’s language when they’re looking for information and match your site’s structure accordingly.
This is where Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer comes in handy. You can enter any topic and find the exact keywords people <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> for. For instance, there are over 65,000 keywords about gardening that people search for in the US, getting almost 700,000 searches per month:
Check out my full process for building out an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> topic map to help you find the best keywords to target.
As you identify relevant keywords and topics, you’ll need to decide which ones are worth adding as <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> on your website. It helps to use a visual planning tool like Flowmapp:
Each page has its own card where you can add <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> and design information, like:
You can also <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> tags to map out each page’s intent.
Not all <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> serve the same purpose. Some exist to capture organic traffic, while others are about brand building, lead nurturing, or support.
Once you know what <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> you’ll be creating and how they will fit on your website, you’ll need to plan out the URL structure.
Make sure to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> keywords naturally, avoid going deeper than three levels, and keep things clean and descriptive.
<p>Check out these helpful guides on best practices for URLs and website structure if you get stuck:</p>
Navigation is where your information architecture becomes real for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>rs. It’s the set of cues that tells visitors where they are, where they can go next, and how to get there.
Done well, it keeps people engaged and reduces bounce rates. Done poorly, it overwhelms users and creates crawl inefficiencies that hurt <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a>.
Common types of navigation elements <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>d on websites include:
<p>Your main navigation should be clean and purposeful.</p>
For example, this is what it currently looks <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> for Ahrefs:
<p>For best UX, keep the number of horizontal items to a maximum of seven. Seven is a magic number in menu engineering. It provides enough choice without being excessive. This is based on cognitive load theory and the fact that too many options can lead to analysis paralysis.</p>
You can, however, use drop-downs to add more <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> without overwhelming users.
<p>For instance, Ahrefs’ products are featured in a drop-down as a mega-menu style:</p>
You can also <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> a list design like we do on the blog:
<p>In general, it’s best to limit the number of top-level links to avoid decision fatigue.</p>
Every extra item increases cognitive load. So, prioritize your highest-value <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> and conversion pages here.
For example, service-based businesses often highlight “Services,” “Industries,” and “Case Studies,” while e-commerce sites might <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> “Shop,” “Categories,” and “Sale Items.”
<p>The footer navigation plays a different role.</p>
It’s the place to include medium-tier <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> pages that don’t deserve main menu space but still need visibility. It’s also a great place for legal pages, credibility building, and essential brand information.
<p>For example, here’s a simple footer design for a local plumbing business:</p>
For a blog, you may decide to switch things up by adding blog categories, a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> function, or resources.
Other internal navigation elements within the page are just as important. Sidebars, breadcrumbs, and in-content links guide <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>rs deeper into your site.
Breadcrumb navigation, in particular, supports both UX and SEO by reinforcing hierarchy, clarifying location, and giving <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines a map of your structure. Here’s what that may look like:
<p>Check out our ultimate guide on website navigation for more tips.</p>
And always remember that clarity is more important than creativity when designing any navigation element. Overly clever or vague labels or experimental menu designs might look trendy, but they conf<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> visitors and frustrate crawlers.
<p>For example, this book publisher’s navigation sounds exciting:</p>
But it was very difficult for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a>rs to find what they were looking for before the company changed it to clearer menu options!
Moral of the story: stick with familiar conventions, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> keywords where it makes sense, and make the flow from one page to another intuitive.
Once your site structure is in place, the next step is designing page layouts that work for both users and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines.
Layouts dictate how information is presented, how easily people can engage with it, and how <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines interpret the content. A strong design balances clarity, scannability, and relevance without overwhelming the visitor or stripping out the elements SEO needs.
Unfortunately, this step is where most people go wrong (designers and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> professionals alike).
Designers often prioritize minimal designs with little text, which gives <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines very little context to work with. Chanel’s home page, for instance, has fewer than 100 words, prioritizing visuals over content.
It’s great for aesthetics, poor for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> visibility.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a>s, on the other hand, often swing too far in the opposite direction, creating walls of text that overwhelm visitors…
<p>… or designing very cluttered layouts:</p>
So, think of yourself as Goldilocks in this exercise, finding the ideal balance between design and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> needs for each page.
<p>Start by applying core UX principles to your page layouts:</p>
<p>With these essentials in mind, move on to wireframing.</p>
A wireframe is a basic sketch of a webpage that shows where things <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> headlines, text, and buttons will go before the final design is created.
You can <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> any whiteboard or sketching tool like FigJam or Miro to create something like this.
This step is critical because it forces you to think about user intent and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> goals at the same time.
For example, an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> page targeting “commercial plumbing services” should lead with a strong hero section answering the query, then build credibility with supporting sections like case studies, FAQs, or reviews layered in logical order.
<p>A strong page layout usually includes:</p>
Not sure how much content your page needs? Tools <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">like</a> Ahrefs’ AI Content Helper can give you a precise word count recommendation based on what’s currently ranking.
You’ll also get an idea of what content is needed for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> sections on the page to cover the topic deeply.
That way, you’re not guessing. Instead, you’re building layouts that balance <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> competitiveness with user-friendly design.
This balance between UX and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> best practices ensures your content not only ranks well but also delivers experiences that keep visitors on-site and convert.
Internal links are the pathways that connect your pages together. They help users move through your site naturally and show <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines which pages are most important.
From an SEO perspective, internal links distribute authority across your site and show <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines which pages are your most important ones.
You can plan out your internal links visually by connecting the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> you think could link to each other, even if they’re from different sections of your site.
The first principle of internal linking is relevance. Links should feel natural, pointing to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> that genuinely help the reader take the next step.
<p>Anchor text also matters. This is the clickable text that is turned into a link. For instance, in this further reading widget, the anchor text is “beginner-friendly guide”:</p>
Instead of vague anchors like click here, use descriptive wording that tells people (and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines) what to expect.
When linking to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> pages, it helps to incorporate keywords where possible, as long as they read naturally with the sentence. Don’t force them just for the sake of SEO.
<p>Also, make sure you don’t always just include the exact keyword all the time. Switch it up from time to time.</p>
<p>If you have an existing website, you can find easy internal link opportunities in Ahrefs’ Site Audit tool.</p>
This report tells you exactly where to add internal links to help rank your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> higher in Google.
Check out our guide on Internal Links for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> for more detailed tips to improve your website’s links for SEO and UX.
Optimizing your website’s performance is as much about user experience as <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a>.
Even the best-designed site can fail if it performs poorly. <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> engines want to reward pages that are fast, accessible, and engaging, because those are the ones users trust.
<p>The best place to start is running a crawl in Ahrefs’ Site Audit to uncover potential usability issues your site may have.</p>
<p>It goes beyond surface-level checks by flagging issues that frustrate visitors and undermine rankings:</p>
<p>With over 170 technical factors checked for each page, it’s a comprehensive look at your website. Once you run a crawl for your website, check the All issues report for any usability and performance errors:</p>
<p>These measure your website’s UX performance.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure how to fix any issues that show up for your website, click the question mark symbols for an explanation:</p>
You can also get data directly from Google <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a>peed Insights by enabling Core Web Vitals in your crawl settings:
<p>This will unlock more insights into any usability issues on your website.</p>
<p>For instance, the Performance report becomes a nice dashboard giving you a bird’s-eye view of your site’s UX performance:</p>
These metrics aren’t direct ranking factors on their own, but they reveal friction points that lead to poor engagement, exactly the kind of signals that can erode <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> visibility over time.
You can also <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">use</a> behavioral analytics tools like Microsoft Clarity or Crazy Egg to see how people interact with your site.
Patterns such as rage clicks, dead clicks, or quick backs (when users return immediately to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> results) highlight where a searcher’s intent and your content don’t match. Quick backs, in particular, are an SEO red flag: they often signal that your content ranks but doesn’t satisfy the searcher, a problem that can cost you visibility in the long run.
<p>The goal isn’t just hitting technical benchmarks.</p>
It’s creating a site that feels seamless: fast to load, easy to navigate, and reliable on any device. By using Ahrefs’ Site Audit to monitor technical health alongside user engagement data, you’ll ensure your site stays both <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a>-friendly and genuinely enjoyable to use.
Bringing UX and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> together works best when both disciplines respect each other’s strengths.
<p>Problems often arise when one side dominates the process, leading to sites that look polished but can’t rank, or sites that rank but frustrate visitors.</p>
<p>Here are the most common mistakes to watch out for.</p>
The takeaway? <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> and UX are complementary and must work in tandem. Avoiding extremes on both ends creates a discoverable, engaging website that’s built to convert.
UX and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">seo</a> shouldn’t be separate checkboxes on your website to-do list. They’re interconnected forces that determine how people find, experience, and trust your brand online.
By aligning structure, navigation, page layouts, internal links, and performance, you create a site that’s both discoverable in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">search</a> and delightful to use.
Ahrefs’ tools like Keywords Explorer, AI Content Helper, and Site Audit make it easier to bridge the gap, showing you what <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> to build, how to structure them, and where to optimize.
The result: <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115022-tailscale-is-pretty-useful.html">pages</a> that rank higher, convert better, and give good UX.
