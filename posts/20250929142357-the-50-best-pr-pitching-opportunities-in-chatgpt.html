<p>Pitching these outlets means your brand gets in front of readers, circulates on social media, ranks in search, and now resurfaces in AI.</p>
<p>Below are the top 50 most-cited publisher and editorial sites in ChatGPT that accept PR pitches.</p>
<p>If ChatGPT is regularly citing a site, it’s a signal that the content is trusted, authoritative, and likely to keep surfacing in future responses.</p>
<p>Reaching a publisher’s human readership is already hugely valuable, but now that same media coverage can boost your odds of appearing in AI answers at scale.</p>
<p>When we looked at the parent companies behind these publishers, one name kept coming up: People Inc.</p>
<p>In all, 16 of the top 50 most AI-cited, pitchable publications came from People Inc—including The Spruce, In Style, and Health.com.</p>
<p>Condé Nast publications also showed up multiple times (e.g. Wired, Vogue, GQ).</p>
<p>Here’s what this data means for anyone looking to turn ChatGPT citations into PR opportunities:</p>
<p>I exported and scoured through the top 1000 domains cited in ChatGPT conversations, using Ahrefs Brand Radar.</p>
<p>To understand whether the site was open to receiving pitches, I did one of two things:</p>
<p>I performed a Google site search for the words “According to” to get an idea of whether a publisher had accepted pitches from brands in the past.</p>
<p>Obviously not every instance of the phrase “According to” gives way to a PR mention.</p>
<p>But, generally speaking, if a publisher does reference an external source, this is a good catch-all term to spot those mentions.</p>
<p>I only included instances where brands had been mentioned. If the publication cited universities or research bodies–not brands–I left them out.</p>
<ol>
<li>Checked for evidence on the publisher’s site</li>
</ol>
<p>If things were still a bit unclear, I looked for confirmation of pitch acceptance on the site’s media, editorial, and contact pages.</p>
<p>While it’s smart to target media outlets that dominate in citation volume, what matters even more is getting coverage on trusted domains that are relevant to your audience and your niche.</p>
<p>AI systems prioritize contextually relevant information, so being featured on an industry-appropriate site can carry more weight than appearing in a high-volume but less relevant publication.</p>
<p>Here are two ways you can find PR opportunities that are both highly visible and highly relevant.</p>
<p>Find the publications that routinely mention your competitors but not you.</p>
<p>Just head to Ahrefs Brand Radar, navigate to the “Cited domains” report, then configure filters to find AI queries and responses that contain your competitor, but don’t contain your brand.</p>
<p>In return, you’ll get a list of domains/publishers responsible for your competitor’s branded AI mentions.</p>
<p>In this example, I’ve focused on Asana and Clickup.</p>
<p>Asana is cited 33.8K times across all AI surfaces…</p>
<p>While Clickup is cited 14.8K times…</p>
<p>If Clickup is aiming for more AI visibility (because, who isn’t?) they may want to pitch major publications like Tech Radar, Forbes, The Guardian, Lifewire, and Wired…</p>
<p>Together, these publications generate 800+ AI mentions for Asana.</p>
<p>Tracking who promotes your competitors—and how that shows up in AI—is a great way to find new pitching leads.</p>
<p>Ahrefs Brand Radar now shows you the overarching topics you’re visible for in AI…</p>
<p>You can find PR opportunities from the publishers cited alongside those target topics.</p>
<p>For example, here are all the major press sites being referenced in ChatGPT alongside the topic of AI…</p>
<p>If you want to tie your brand to the topic of AI, Tech Radar is the go-to publisher to pitch.</p>
<p>The shift from link building to AI visibility changes how and where you pitch.</p>
<p>Having a list of the most-cited ChatGPT publishers is a strong starting point, but the real opportunity is in the overlap: outlets that are visible and relevant to your niche.</p>
<p>If you pitch where your topics and competitors already get coverage, you’ll give yourself the best shot at appearing in AI results.</p>
