<p>SEO for Paws, is a live-streamed fundraiser founded by Anton Shulke, an expert at organizing events, to help a charity close to his heart.</p>
<p>Anton has tirelessly continued his support for his favorite charity, which aids the many pets that were left behind in Kyiv after war broke out in Ukraine. The previous event in March managed to generate approx $7,000 for the worthy cause, with all funds going straight to the shelters where it’s needed.</p>

<p>Among the many pet shelters that SEO For Paws has helped is an apartment run by Alya, who cares for up to 50 animals.</p>
<p>Alya has always cared for animals, and meeting an old, sick cat she called Fox was the start of becoming an organized shelter.</p>
<p>In 2016, she started with five cats living in her apartment, and today has 50 alongside 15 of her grandmother’s cats.</p>
<p>There’s a lot involved in care for this many animals, including the feeding, cleaning, washing litter boxes, replacing litter, and performing hygiene or medical procedures when needed.</p>
<p>Running a home-based shelter is not easy. Sometimes it’s sad, sometimes it’s exhausting. But Alya says that looking around at all the little whiskered faces, the furry bodies sprawled across the furniture, makes it worth it. Giving them a life of warmth, food, and love is worth every challenge.</p>
<p>To keep supporting individuals like Alya, we need your help. You can donate via Anton’s Buy Me a Coffee.</p>
<p>The upcoming “SEO for Paws” livestream aims to continue fundraising efforts. The event, which runs from 12:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. ET, will offer actionable SEO and digital marketing advice from experts while raising money for the animal shelters.</p>
<p>Headline speakers who have donated their time to support his cause include Andrey Lipattsev, David Carrasco, Olga Zarr, Judith Lewis, James Wirth, Zach Chahalis, Jamie Indigo, and Lee Elliott.</p>
<p>Attendance is free, but participants are encouraged to donate to help the charity.</p>
<p>The “SEO for Paws” live stream is an opportunity to make a meaningful difference while listening to excellent speakers.</p>
<p>All money raised is donated to help cats and dogs in Ukraine.</p>
