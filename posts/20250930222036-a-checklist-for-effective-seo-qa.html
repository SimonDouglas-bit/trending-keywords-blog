<p>Engineering teams usually have a quality assurance (QA) process.</p>
<p>Without it, they risk releasing work that hurts the user experience and creates unforeseen technical issues – including major SEO problems.</p>
<p>That’s where SEO QA comes in. Adding SEO-specific checks to existing QA protocols helps teams catch and fix issues before they go live.</p>
<p>But this step is less common than you’d think. Too often, it’s overlooked.</p>
<p>This article outlines what it takes to build an effective SEO QA discipline and provides a checklist SEOs and QA engineers can use to cover their bases.</p>
<p>Unless SEO is fully integrated with engineering, SEO-specific QA often gets overlooked.</p>
<p>As a result, SEOs may not flag problems until a tech audit – or worse, when they show up as organic KPI declines. </p>
<p>This is especially common when SEO teams sit under marketing instead of product or engineering, since they’re excluded from regular milestones and lifecycle meetings. </p>
<p>That makes it harder to communicate SEO’s importance, win buy-in, and establish it as part of everyday development.</p>
<p>Having a QA team within engineering is also no longer a given.</p>
<p>In agile environments, some teams prioritize speed over fully clean rollouts.</p>
<p>Others rely on AI tools to automate QA or monitor for technical issues, instead of employing dedicated QA engineers.</p>
<p>In short, there are plenty of reasons many teams lack a well-developed SEO QA practice.</p>
<p>For SEOs to be able to proactively find and resolve issues before they go out into the world, they need two things on a regular basis:</p>
<p>This has a few key benefits for the business:</p>
<p>The last bullet is just as much of a reason to implement SEO QA as the first two. </p>
<p>It’s not just about catching bugs, it’s about maximizing value while minimizing resources. </p>
<p>When SEOs have a chance to see what’s coming up, it allows them to connect the dots between SEO roadmap items and upcoming engineering initiatives to find potential areas of overlap. </p>
<p>In turn, the business reaps the SEO benefits of work that’s already in motion, rather than spending additional resources to achieve the same goal later. </p>
<p>Alright, now that we’ve established why brands need SEO QA, let’s get into the logistics.</p>
<p>Ensure QA is performed by:</p>
<p>Define a checklist of core, critical SEO items that should be a part of QA for any ticket flagged as having potential SEO impact.</p>
<p>The cadence for SEO QA should mimic the site’s development release cycle and existing engineering QA processes. </p>
<p>Test in staging before anything goes to production. </p>
<p>Some elements might need to be tested in production if they affect indexing or crawlability of content. </p>
<p>Implement monitoring tools as a safeguard that helps catch any errors that somehow make it to production.</p>
<p>When SEO requests development work, they write the acceptance criteria in the product requirements and review the work before release.</p>
<p>But not all tickets that affect SEO go through that process, which makes an SEO QA checklist essential.</p>
<p>The checklist can be used by any SEO or QA engineer on any release flagged for SEO impact.</p>
<p>It’s a comprehensive list of core items, organized by category, to ensure issues don’t reach production.</p>
<p>For pages to get indexed, search engines need to access URLs, crawl the content, and use it as context. </p>
<p>That’s pretty fundamental to SEO, and a big reason we start here.</p>
<p>Note: Crawl issues often impact large swaths of the site because changes can occur across an entire page template or subfolder.</p>
<p>Are all of the following still available and correct?</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>You can see CSS issues because they visually impact the page. </p>
<p>For JavaScript issues, you’ll need tools to understand whether crawlers can access critical content. </p>
<p>Unless you’re already running a sitewide crawl with JavaScript enabled, test one or two pages from the affected template (i.e., blog, listing, product detail) using a tool like Rendering Difference Engine.</p>
<p>Google crawls mobile-first. So if you’re only checking on desktop, you’re skipping SEO QA.</p>
<p>If it’s not part of QA, broken tracking is a recipe for panic. </p>
<p>The team will not find the issue until they see KPIs like organic traffic decline. </p>
<p>Even worse, until it’s fixed, that’s historical data that you won’t get back. </p>
<p>Before launch on staging, check if:</p>
<p>The day after launch, verify that:</p>
<p>Not all A/B testing tools distinguish the control and variant for crawlers. </p>
<p>They’re usually served one or the other version of the page randomly, which means your variant could impact SEO.</p>
<p>With every round of QA, engineers and SEOs will learn nuances and find new connections. </p>
<p>You’ll discover that certain types of updates are more likely to cause certain types of SEO issues, certain plugins are linked to certain types of problems, etc.</p>
<p>Your SEO QA checklist is a living, breathing document and a place to document all of this to make SEO QA more effective – and avoid repeating mistakes – no matter who’s carrying it out. </p>
<p>Start with the list below and make it your own over time.</p>
