<p>The number of websites linking to this post.</p>
<p>This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic.</p>
<p>But even if you’re our most loyal fan, there will still be plenty of insights that you’ve missed or have forgotten already. Many of these ideas are too good to let vanish.</p>
<p>So we went back through our catalog and rescued the insights from our guests that deserve to be referenced over and over again.</p>
<p>The best part? Many of our guests will also be on stage at Ahrefs Evolve in San Diego on October 14 and 15.</p>
<p>So, think of this as both the director’s cut of our podcast and your front-row preview to Ahrefs Evolve.</p>
<p>Mark Schaefer is a globally-recognized author, keynote speaker, futurist, and business consultant who blogs at {grow}, one of the top five marketing blogs in the world. He also teaches graduate marketing classes at Rutgers University and has written 10 best-selling books.</p>
<p>When he came on the podcast, he didn’t sugarcoat it.</p>
<p>“If you’re just competent, you’re going to be eaten alive by AI. AI is already competent. It’s more than competent. It’s magical. So we’ve got to dig deep and do better.”</p>
<p>How do we do better? Mark says we should make marketing more human, more like art.</p>
<p>we need to teach through our stories, our experiences, our education. We have to talk about what makes us happy, what makes us excited, what makes us angry, because that’s what will connect with people. It’s this expression of the human experience. That’s what art is. It’s an expression of the human experience.”</p>
<p>Mark will be speaking on “How Humans Win in an Al Marketing World” at Ahrefs Evolve. See Mark live at Ahrefs Evolve, San Diego.</p>
<p>Emily Kramer is a leading voice in B2B startup marketing. She previously led and built marketing teams from the ground up at Asana, Carta, Astro (acquired by Slack), and Ticketfly and has been the first-ish marketer 4 times, leading teams through hypergrowth and at scale.</p>
<p>On the podcast, she explained why so many founders misdiagnose their marketing problems.</p>
<p>Emily breaks startup marketing into three parts:</p>
<p>She also urges startups to look for what she calls marketing advantages: the unfair edges that only your company has. At Carta, that meant using their proprietary data to publish a landmark report on the gender equity gap. The campaign was provocative, press-worthy, and put Carta on the map.</p>
<p>Emily will be speaking on “Lessons for Small Content Teams: How I Manage My Content Strategy As A Two-Person Team And A Newsletter With ~70k Subscribers” at Ahrefs Evolve. See Emily live at Ahrefs Evolve, San Diego.</p>
<p>Peep Laja is a 3x founder (Wynter, CXL, Speero). Today, he’s a recognized expert in strategy, messaging, and market research.</p>
<p>On the podcast, Peep was blunt about why so much content marketing fails:</p>
<p>For him, content that wins needs to be either:</p>
<p>Everything else is noise.</p>
<p>Peep will be speaking on “B2B Brands Don’t Have A Pipeline Problem, They Have A Recall Problem” at Ahrefs Evolve. See Peep live at Ahrefs Evolve, San Diego.</p>
<p>Delbert Ty is a fractional CMO who is the ex-CMO at Coffee Meets Bagel, a popular dating app. Before joining CmB, Delbert worked as Head of Marketing at Circles.Life—a Singaporean telco—where he grew revenue to 9 figures in 5 years.</p>
<p>Having been behind some of APAC’s wildest marketing stunts, he’s honest:</p>
<p>Some of his best stunts (and misses):</p>
<p>How Delbert decides what to ship:</p>
<p>Delbert was part of a panel at Ahrefs Evolve 2024 and also spoke at Ahrefs Evolve Mini 2025 in Singapore.</p>
<p>Madhav Bhandari is CMO at Storylane, an AI-native platform for creating interactive demos in minutes, giving buyers a hands-on way to test-drive products.</p>
<p>On the podcast, he shared his biggest insight: Early-stage marketing isn’t about following a playbook. It’s actually about building a portfolio of experiments.</p>
<p>Instead of searching for one silver-bullet channel, Madhav runs dozens of small experiments quickly, then doubles down on the two or three that work.</p>
<p>He also warns against overcomplicating attribution too early: what matters is trust and directional signals, not perfect data.</p>
<p>Madhav will be speaking on “How We 7x’d Brand Awareness in 6 Quarters Using ‘Pattern Interrupt Marketing’” at Ahrefs Evolve. See Madhav live at Ahrefs Evolve, San Diego.</p>
<p>Glen Allsopp is the Head of Marketing Strategy and Research at Ahrefs. He’s also the founder of Detailed.com and the Detailed SEO extension, which we acquired in September 2025.</p>
<p>Before joining Ahrefs, he was on the podcast sharing his vast SEO and business wisdom with the world.</p>
<p>His edge comes from obsessive depth: doing the work others won’t.</p>
<p>That level of rigor has earned him mentions in TechCrunch, Financial Times, and Business Insider.</p>
<p>His lesson for marketers is simple: go deeper than anyone else in your industry. True differentiation comes from effort others aren’t willing to invest.</p>
<p>Glen is notoriously private and will likely not be found speaking at any events. But look forward to his articles on our blog!</p>
<p>Chris Cunningham is the Head of Social Marketing at ClickUp and one of its four people who started the company. During his time at the company, ClickUp has grown to over 1,400 employees, raised $535 million at a $4 billion valuation, and run major campaigns including a Super Bowl commercial.</p>
<p>He also built ClickUp’s content into the best in B2B SaaS, surpassing 1 billion impressions in 2024.</p>
<p>What’s his secret? Treat content like a creative studio.</p>
<p>Instead of pushing product updates, Chris hired actors, writers, and comedians to make workplace sketches that are funny, relatable, and endlessly shareable. Then, when the audience is warmed up, ClickUp retargets them with product-led ads.</p>
<p>But Chris believes this isn’t just ClickUp’s advantage. It’s the future:</p>
<p>His advice to marketers is simple: stop following “best practices,” study what actually entertains people, and invest in talent that can pull it off. Because in a world where attention is scarce, every SaaS company is competing with Netflix and TikTok.</p>
<p>Chris will be speaking on “The SaaS Social Playbook: Turning Organic Content Into a Growth Channel” at Ahrefs Evolve. See Chris live at Ahrefs Evolve, San Diego.</p>
<p>Melissa Laurie is one of the leading voices on EGC (Employee Generated Content). Through her agency Oysterly Media, she’s helped brands like SEPHORA, Salesforce, and even the Singapore Police Force, turn their employees into a powerful marketing channel.</p>
<p>Her big idea flips the usual “employee advocacy” script: have employees create short videos that go on your brand’s channels, because authenticity beats polish and scales across recruiting, culture, and sales.</p>
<p>Short video is now how people search and discover. That means your brand feeds can’t be occasional press releases; they need a steady cadence of human clips from real teammates: product tips, day-in-the-life, quick stories, green-screen explainers. But it only works if you treat it like a program, not a one-off.</p>
<p>Melissa’s playbook in a nutshell:</p>
<p>If your brand is still trying to pass off TV spots as Reels, you’re “putting lipstick on a pig.” Put real people, real voices, and useful micro-stories on your brand account and make it a habit.</p>
<p>Melissa spoke at Ahrefs Evolve Mini 2025 in Singapore!</p>
<p>Kevin Indig is an advisor to some of the world’s fastest-growing startups and has defined organic growth strategies for companies like Ramp, Reddit, Bounce, Dropbox, Hims, Nextdoor and Snapchat. He led SEO and Growth at the world’s leading e-commerce platform Shopify, the #1 marketplace for software G2 and the #1 developer company Atlassian.</p>
<p>On the podcast, Kevin made one bold prediction:</p>
<p>But rather than declaring SEO dead, Kevin sees it evolving. Traffic may decline, but revenue doesn’t necessarily follow the same path, especially as AI Overviews start showing up for more commercial queries.</p>
<p>His advice for SEOs is simple: Don’t just optimize for keywords, optimize for actions. Every search is a step toward doing something: buying, solving, creating. If your site only informs but doesn’t help people act, they’ll go to AI instead.</p>
<p>Kevin will be speaking on “What Content Works Well in LLMs” at Ahrefs Evolve. See Kevin live at Ahrefs Evolve, San Diego.</p>
<p>John-Henry Scherck is the founder and CEO of Growth Plays, a leading B2B content strategy &amp; SEO agency that works with mid-market and enterprise technology businesses to drive pipeline, not just page views.</p>
<p>The core lesson from his episode: Traffic alone is worthless unless it drives revenue.</p>
<p>That’s why JH is skeptical of the hype around “zero-volume keywords.” Sure, some may bring in a trickle of traffic, but they rarely move the needle for venture-scale SaaS companies:</p>
<p>Instead, he urges marketers to think bigger:</p>
<p>For JH, it all comes back to a simple truth: volume is vanity, revenue is sanity.</p>
<p>John-Henry will be speaking on “Adopting Al: Everything We’ve Learned Becoming an Al-First Agency” at Ahrefs Evolve. See John-Henry live at Ahrefs Evolve, San Diego.</p>
<p>Neil Patel is one of the most recognizable names in digital marketing. He’s the co-founder of NP Digital, which has grown into a global agency with over $100M in annual revenue, plus software businesses like Ubersuggest and AnswerThePublic.</p>
<p>On the podcast, Neil cut through the noise about why agencies really fail to scale:</p>
<p>For Neil, the key to reducing churn is expanding the relationship. If a client only hires you for SEO, they’ll churn. But if they rely on you for SEO, paid, email, and CRO, you become indispensable.</p>
<p>He also emphasized the importance of targeting enterprise clients:</p>
<p>It’s not about closing the deal once; it’s about keeping the deal for a decade.</p>
<p>If there’s one common pattern across these episodes, it’s this: The winners in marketing do what’s hard. They obsess over depth, take risks and ship “bad ideas” in order to find great ones (i.e. build a portfolio of bets), out-human the machines, and measure success by outcomes, not vanity.</p>
<p>Ahrefs Evolve is your chance to take those ideas off the page and into practice. You’ll hear the unfiltered versions on stage, ask follow-up questions in person, and swap notes with marketers who are running the exact plays you care about.</p>
<p>See you at Ahrefs Evolve in San Diego, October 14–15.</p>
