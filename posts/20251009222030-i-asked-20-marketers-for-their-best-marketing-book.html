<p>Author: Eric Ries</p>
<p>Recommended by: Travis Tallent</p>
<p>This is the blueprint for building results with fast feedback. Treat campaigns like experiments, ship smaller bets, measure learning, and iterate. It turns “failed” ideas into fuel for the next win.</p>
<p>Author: Adam Grant</p>
<p>Recommended by: Heather Physioc</p>
<p>In Hidden Potential, Adam Grant challenges the idea of “natural talent.” He argues that success comes from habits, feedback loops, and environments that stretch your abilities: lessons every marketer can apply to creative and professional growth.</p>
<p>It’s exactly why Heather recommends the book:</p>
<p>Recommended by: Patrick Stox</p>
<p>Patrick’s pick is close to home. The Ahrefs SEO Book is our comprehensive guide to mastering modern SEO, from fundamentals to advanced link-building and technical strategies.</p>
<p>As Patrick puts it:</p>
<p>Author: Robert Cialdini</p>
<p>Recommended by: Dawood Bukhari</p>
<p>Few books have influenced marketers more than Cialdini’s Influence. It’s the cornerstone of understanding why people say “yes,” from reciprocity to social proof.</p>
<p>Dawood, who’s publishing a book on Digital PR, uses these principles daily in his work.</p>
<p>Author: Eli Schwartz</p>
<p>Recommended by: Sophie Brannon</p>
<p>Eli Schwartz reframes SEO not as a checklist, but as a strategic growth function tied directly to business outcomes. It’s a must-read for marketers who want to think beyond rankings and connect search with company strategy.</p>
<p>Author: John Kotter</p>
<p>Recommended by: Chris Schweppe</p>
<p>John Kotter’s management classic is about transformation and what it really takes to make change stick. For marketers leading teams or implementing new processes, it’s a timeless guide to creating momentum and aligning people around a shared vision.</p>
<p>Author: W. Chan Kim &amp; Renée Mauborgne</p>
<p>Recommended by: Carrie Rose, Brandon Lincoln Hendricks</p>
<p>Blue Ocean Strategy is a manifesto for differentiation. It’s about finding opportunities where competitors don’t, and creating demand instead of fighting for it.</p>
<p>As Brandon says:</p>
<p>This book is strategy for people who want to lead markets, not follow them. It’s about creating value where competition becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>Author: Peter Drucker</p>
<p>Recommended by: Mark Schaefer</p>
<p>Peter Drucker’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship may be decades old, but its lessons still apply: innovation isn’t luck; it’s a process. Drucker’s thinking has shaped generations of marketers, entrepreneurs, and leaders.</p>
<p>Author: Cameron Herold</p>
<p>Recommended by: James Norquay</p>
<p>Cameron Herold’s Double Double is equal parts playbook and pep talk. It’s full of practical, actionable ways to grow a business, from leadership habits to marketing strategy.</p>
<p>Here’s why James recommends the book:</p>
<p>Author: Richard Koch</p>
<p>Recommended by: Madhav Bhandari</p>
<p>Koch’s 80/20 Principle is simple but powerful: most results come from a small number of actions. For marketers, it’s a reminder to focus energy on the campaigns, channels, and ideas that truly move the needle.</p>
<p>As Madhav puts it:</p>
<p>In marketing, that means identifying the 20% of initiatives that drive 80% of the results. The 20% of SEO tactics that move 80% of the needle. The 20% of hires who deliver 80% of the impact. Even the 20% of my day where I get 80% of my productivity.</p>
<p>That way of thinking has helped me focus my energy in the right places and kept me from ever feeling overwhelmed—whether in marketing or in life.</p>
<p>Author: Robert Bly</p>
<p>Recommended by: Cyrus Shepard</p>
<p>Robert Bly’s classic is still one of the best introductions to persuasive writing. It’s straightforward, timeless, and filled with examples you can apply to any kind of marketing copy.</p>
<p>Cyrus puts it simply:</p>
<p>Author: April Dunford</p>
<p>Recommended by: John-Henry Scherck</p>
<p>April Dunford demystifies positioning and makes it practical. Her framework shows how to communicate your product’s value so clearly that customers instantly understand why it matters. It’s a must-read for anyone working in SaaS or B2B marketing.</p>
<p>Author: Peter Thiel, Blake Masters</p>
<p>Recommended by: Kevin Indig</p>
<p>Thiel’s Zero to One isn’t just about startups; it’s about thinking differently. It challenges readers to create something truly original rather than just competing on the same ideas, channels, or strategies.</p>
<p>Author: Steven Johnson</p>
<p>Recommended by: Ryan Law</p>
<p>Johnson explores where creativity really comes from, and why the best ideas emerge from connection, not isolation. It’s a book about the environments that make innovation possible.</p>
<p>Author: Ashley Faus &amp; Devin Bramhall</p>
<p>Recommended by: Devin Bramhall</p>
<p>Human-Centered Marketing explores a simple but powerful idea: marketing works best when it focuses on people, not funnels. It’s about empathy, creativity, and building community around shared ideas.</p>
<p>Devin, who co-authored the book, puts it best:</p>
<p>“Good marketing doesn’t start with what you want to say. It starts with how people feel and what they need.”</p>
<p>Rory Sutherland, Vice Chairman at Ogilvy Group, once tweeted: “The best books to read on advertising aren’t about advertising.”</p>
<p>You can see it’s true: most of the recommended books here are barely about marketing. Instead, they’re about something else: business, productivity, storytelling, psychology, and statistics.</p>
