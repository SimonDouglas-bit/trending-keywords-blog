<p>For years, SEO success was measured by charts pointing up and to the right. </p>
<p>We celebrated traffic spikes, shared screenshots, and treated rising sessions as proof of strategy. </p>
<p>But those days are gone.</p>
<p>The SEO playbook that was glorified for the last 10 years prioritized generating useless hordes of informational traffic.</p>
<p>Marketing teams and agencies alike bamboozled executives by pumping up traffic numbers to obscene levels.</p>
<p>People on LinkedIn celebrated programmatic SEO case studies and “SEO heists” that racked up irrelevant clicks – encouraging copycat behavior that ultimately led to the further enshittification of our beloved SEO profession.</p>
<p>Here’s the aftermath of the SEO heist:</p>
<p>In 2024, Google escalated its war on generic, low-value content marketing by deploying AI Overviews and updating its algorithm to target scaled content abuse.</p>
<p>It turns out that impressions were inflated all along thanks to SEO tool scraping. </p>
<p>But we can’t blame it all on SEO tool scraping. </p>
<p>The B2B SEO playbook became a cookie-cutter formulaic bastardization of HubSpot’s inbound marketing model, which encouraged the prioritization of high-volume definitional search terms, often via glossary pages and FAQ directories. </p>
<p>That’s why if you examine any Cybersecurity company, they all have the same SEO strategy.</p>
<p>And let’s be real: most websites never deserved those clicks in the first place.</p>
<p>They were either topically irrelevant or played a questionable role in influencing conversions.</p>
<p>A B2B cybertech client saw a 70% drop in traffic to its glossary pages.</p>
<p>A martech company experienced a similar 70% decline in its FAQ content.</p>
<p>A business operations brand lost around 60% of visits to its definitions section.</p>
<p>And a B2B data operations client reported a 55% decrease in glossary traffic.</p>
<p>Top-of-funnel clicks are being eaten alive due to AI’s ability to easily summarize consensus information based on its own training data, driving even more zero-click searches. </p>
<p>Because so many categories are topically mature, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc., have already scraped the answers to most generic queries, which are pre-loaded in their index of training data.</p>
<p>For pre-loaded AI answers that don’t involve LLM grounding, there’s no chance of getting your brand recommended, and no chance of earning a citation.</p>
<p>AI Overviews targeting informational queries are simply a continuation of what we previously saw with featured snippets and People Also Ask boxes, reducing traffic opportunities.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Across dozens of GSC accounts, the trend is clear – educational blogging as a marketing strategy has stopped delivering results.</p>
<p>These clicks rarely influenced conversions and now account for most traffic losses. </p>
<p>Companies that have pumped up vanity traffic are paying the price.</p>
<p>Pages comparing solutions or providing evaluation content still attract users who are actively considering purchases. </p>
<p>Optimizing for AI-driven search and grounded prompts still pays off.</p>
<p>High-intent queries like “best insider threat platforms” require citations and grounded answers. </p>
<p>AI cannot fully replace these pages, making them high-value for organic search and revenue attribution.</p>
<p>Homepage traffic is rising in the AI era, Siege Media found. </p>
<p>Companies that invest in reputation, commercial intent content marketing, and ecosystem management will maintain visibility, even as AI-generated answers dominate consensus topics. </p>
<p>Prompt monitoring in AI search is quickly becoming the new keyword rank tracking.</p>
<p>This shift is the next evolution beyond the Great Decoupling: it’s the Great Normalization where top-of-funnel traffic is rapidly declining, and brands are forced to compete with a lower inventory of available clicks but more meaningful engagement from higher intent searches.</p>
<p>A recent study by Semrush found that: </p>
<p>Here’s how to adapt your SEO strategy for the Great Normalization – and focus on metrics that truly reflect impact.</p>
<p>The Great SEO Normalization is a much needed strategic correction. </p>
<p>Top-of-funnel clicks are disappearing, but branded traffic, middle-and bottom-of-funnel optimization matter more than ever.</p>
<p>Companies that adapt their SEO strategy to this new reality will thrive. </p>
<p>Focus on what influences conversions and embrace a new era where traditional search and AI search coexist. </p>
