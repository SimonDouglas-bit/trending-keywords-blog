<p>Try this SEO-specific range of AI prompt ideas and example templates to be more efficient and productive in less time</p>
<p>AI provides many ways to augment and assist how SEOs work. From analyzing SERP intent, to brainstorming content strategy for new pages, to running competitive analysis, to producing stakeholder-ready presentations, the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>More and more marketers are experimenting with AI prompts to use AI tools as an assistant where an effective prompt can save hours of manual work.</p>
<p>You can start out with basic level prompts of a simple paragraph, but to take your prompting to the next level, apply a coding mindset of instruction hierarchy and referencing other documents for context.</p>
<p>To create an effective prompt, it must have:</p>
<p>Here is a list of example expert-level prompts put together by our team at SEJ to help with SEO tasks. Adapt to meet your needs:</p>
<p>Turn customer struggles into search demand by mapping functional, emotional, and social “jobs” into authentic queries, mapped by funnel stage and content gaps.</p>
<p>Expands a seed keyword into 40-60 related queries across six categories (People Also Ask, entities, comparisons, how-tos, problems/solutions, transactional modifiers).</p>
<p>The prompt organizes them into a hierarchical H2/H3 content outline with scoring and rationale, so you get both a complete query set and a blog-ready structure.</p>
<p>Audit your existing content against fan-out queries to expose gaps, shallow coverage, and missed search intents, then rebuild the outline for completeness.</p>
<p>Group keywords into clusters mapped to existing pages or new page needs, calculate opportunity scores, and flag cannibalization risks. (If search volume is included in your export, no extra validation needed.)</p>
<p>Compare two search engine results page (SERP) snapshots to identify movers, new entrants, drop-offs, and feature changes, then extract competitive implications and recommended actions.</p>
<p>Break down top SERP results to identify dominant and secondary search intents, required content elements, and differentiators for ranking.</p>
<p>Create multiple SEO titles targeting different psychological triggers (authority, curiosity, urgency, etc.), all under 60 characters.</p>
<p>Decide when to refresh a page versus create new content, using live SERP data, cannibalization checks, and 24-month trend analysis.</p>
<p>Score content for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness, and get a prioritized list of improvements to strengthen credibility.</p>
<p>Plan a full year of SEO content with seasonal tie-ins, industry events, and keyword themes mapped to business objectives.</p>
<p>Analyze overlapping content, recommend merges or redirects, and produce a migration map that preserves SEO equity.</p>
<p>Run AI-written or draft content through a QA filter for originality, hallucinations, citations, and style alignment before publication.</p>
<p>Deconstruct competitor content pillars, formats, and engagement tactics to surface strategic differentiation opportunities.</p>
<p>Compare your content to top-ranking competitors by depth, format, and UX to identify specific gaps and quick wins.</p>
<p>Generate semantically natural, reader-first internal links with descriptive anchor text that aligns with Google’s guidelines.</p>
<p>Rewrite title tags and descriptions tailored to live SERPs to maximize click-through rate (CTR) while differentiating from competitors.</p>
<p>Audit a page for internal link gaps, visuals, scannability, and takeaways, then prioritize fixes that lift engagement and conversions.</p>
<p>Create unique, city-specific service page variants with local context, pain points, and schema markup.</p>
<p>Generate localized FAQ sections that address community-specific questions, regulations, and competitor differentiators.</p>
<p>Identify precise page-level opportunities and generate personalized outreach emails with evidence.</p>
<p>Build a side-by-side SEO SWOT matrix against a competitor, complete with quantified metrics and five recommended actions.</p>
<p>Identify topics, angles, and formats competitors cover that you don’t, and rank them by search volume and business relevance.</p>
<p>Audit a landing page’s value proposition, calls-to-action (CTAs), and trust signals, then recommend A/B tests to lift conversions.</p>
<p>Analyze CTA copy and form fields to flag friction points, then propose high-converting variations and field reductions.</p>
<p>Translate technical SEO metrics into a narrative of business impact – traffic, revenue, and return on investment (ROI) – for executive audiences.</p>
<p>Extract product features and tools from competitor site structures and map their value propositions to user needs.</p>
<p>Condense monthly SEO metrics into an executive-ready summary with ROI highlights, top wins, and next-month focus.</p>
<p>Transform an SEO strategy into a C-suite deck with outcomes, competitive advantage, and a clear narrative arc.</p>
<p>To make prompts fit for purpose, it’s not as simple as plugging in templates, copying and pasting the output, then calling it a day. It’s important to keep refining every prompt as part of your process. As our in-house expert in large language model (LLM) behavior, Brent Csutoras, points out:</p>
<p>“Make sure that your prompts are the right prompts and that you understand the theory behind it.”</p>
<p>LLMs don’t understand facts the way we humans do, as Brent puts it:</p>
<p>“The problem you have is that you are asking a prediction engine to give you the answer it thinks you want based on some rules that you’ve given it.”</p>
<p>In practice, this means testing, adjusting, and pressure-checking your prompts. Refine them until they consistently deliver results that enhance your workflow and productivity.</p>
<p>Here’s his advice to help you do just that:</p>
<p>We will be updating this list on a regular basis with more prompt ideas and examples to make your SEO more efficient.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: These SEO-focused prompts are not designed to be “one-size-fits-all” because results generated may contain inaccuracies or incomplete data. Always fact-check your outputs against primary sources, review for compliance and accuracy.</p>
