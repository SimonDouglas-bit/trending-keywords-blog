<p>2026 is around the corner – and the SEO space has never been this noisy. Every day brings something new.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get stuck in panic mode, worrying you’re missing the next big thing, or to spend hours scrolling LinkedIn threads that lead nowhere. </p>
<p>In both cases, you end up with nothing concrete – and with stakeholders still expecting clear impact.</p>
<p>As we head into 2026, the real challenge is building a strategy with discipline – one that cuts through the noise and balances:</p>
<p>Finding this balance isn’t easy, but it’s the only way to build a plan that works. </p>
<p>Here’s how to master it – and keep your SEO strategy focused, grounded, and effective in 2026.</p>
<p>Short-term wins are critical because they:</p>
<p>SEO has always been at least a six-month game, but it feels good when a positive trend shows up in your KPIs after just a few weeks.</p>
<p>One challenge with short-term projects is that many people struggle to classify them correctly. </p>
<p>My rule of thumb is simple: short-term wins are things you can deliver yourself, without depending on other teams.</p>
<p>For example, if your CMS lets you insert code directly into pages, adding structured data markup to your most important pages fits that definition perfectly. </p>
<p>There’s still debate about whether structured data affects AI tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity. Maybe it doesn’t. </p>
<p>But it definitely matters for Google, which remains the Goliath of search, handling about 210 times more queries than ChatGPT. </p>
<p>In our case, optimizing markup improved the average positions of some pages almost immediately.</p>
<p>Another example of a short-term bet is optimizing your main pages using a query fan-out technique. </p>
<p>If each page already targets a clear topic and keyword, you can “fan out” by collecting the related questions people ask around that topic.</p>
<p>It’s a straightforward way to boost relevance fast.</p>
<p>This approach also aligns with Kevin Indig’s concept of efficiency-first validations, based on insights from his recent usability study of AI Overviews. </p>
<p>Many users simply want a quick fact or short answer. </p>
<p>By adding FAQs, TL;DR blocks, and schema, you make it easier for AI systems (and Google) to surface your content for exactly those lookups.</p>
<p>Still, short-term projects mainly help you cover the basics and earn quick wins. They rarely position you for the future. </p>
<p>For lasting advantage, you need larger initiatives that take time, involve multiple teams, or require budget planning.</p>
<p>And here’s where many SEOs struggle. They judge projects by complexity instead of dependencies.</p>
<p>A project might look simple on paper, but if it depends on another team, it’s no longer short-term.</p>
<p>Take JavaScript rendering issues, for example. </p>
<p>As an SEO, you can spot them quickly in a Screaming Frog report, but unless the dev team adds them to the roadmap, nothing will move. </p>
<p>And if that team has other priorities, your fix can sit for months.</p>
<p>That’s why I follow this rule: if an optimization project depends on another team, it’s not short-term. </p>
<p>Dependencies work that way. Your priorities aren’t always theirs.</p>
<p>Long-term bets also include strategic plays that need significant planning and preparation. </p>
<p>Think building a presence on Reddit, YouTube, or review sites – platforms that are becoming increasingly important for AI visibility. </p>
<p>Breaking through takes months of consistent work, even with full organizational support.</p>
<p>Everyone is hyped about AI, but it’s not a magic wand. </p>
<p>You can’t expect someone without experience to spin up a YouTube channel or build a Reddit presence just because they have an AI tool. </p>
<p>These things only work when AI is in the hands of people with expertise – otherwise, you risk wasting time and money.</p>
<p>Long-term projects drive results for searches centered on trust and comparison. </p>
<p>As usability research shows, users often skim AI-generated answers but validate them with trusted brands or cross-check perspectives on Reddit, YouTube, and vendor sites.</p>
<p>That’s why long-term bets like building brand authority, scaling video, and nurturing community presence matter. </p>
<p>They won’t deliver quick wins, but over time, they put you where real purchase decisions happen.</p>
<p>Another often-overlooked factor is timing. </p>
<p>Long-term bets must fit into your company’s budget and hiring cycle. </p>
<p>If you need a new role or an expensive tool, you can’t raise your hand midyear and expect fast approval. </p>
<p>I learned that the hard way when I requested a new role in December, after the planning cycle closed in November, and got approval in June – six months lost purely because of timing.</p>
<p>Long-term bets also carry another risk. When you focus too much on them, the basics can slip. </p>
<p>A broken link or a title change on a key page can undo weeks of progress. </p>
<p>If everyone is chasing shiny new things, it’s easy to forget the boring but essential work – like fixing broken links and adding alt text to new pages.</p>
<p>Business-as-usual tasks won’t earn applause in the next all-hands meeting, but without them, everything else rests on shaky ground. </p>
<p>The good news is these tasks are often easy to automate – and plenty of tools already exist to handle them.</p>
<p>For example, we use SEOTesting to:</p>
<p>It’s not glamorous work, but it keeps the site healthy.</p>
<p>The motivation problem, though, is real. </p>
<p>Nobody gets excited about link audits or on-page checks. </p>
<p>As a manager, you need to keep your team engaged in these tasks. </p>
<p>And if you’re working solo, you need to manage your own discipline. </p>
<p>Ignoring BAU is like skipping the gym – you don’t notice the impact right away, but a year later, you’re wondering why nothing fits quite the same.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean your strategy should revolve only around maintenance. </p>
<p>You also need space for experiments – a way to test ideas and uncover what could become tomorrow’s long-term bets.</p>
<p>But how do you bring all these types of projects together without losing focus or sanity?</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Building a sustainable SEO strategy isn’t about choosing between short-term wins, long-term bets, or BAU tasks. It’s about balancing all three. </p>
<p>A framework that works well is to split your time and focus:</p>
<p>Don’t treat the math as exact – the mix will shift with your business cycle. </p>
<p>After a migration or rebrand, BAU naturally dominates. </p>
<p>During quieter periods, you can double down on experiments or long-term plays. </p>
<p>The key is to keep sight of your north-star projects and adjust each sprint without losing track of the bigger goals.</p>
<p>Finding balance also means knowing what belongs in each bucket. </p>
<p>Not every project that looks quick will deliver fast results – and not every long-term bet needs to take a year. </p>
<p>Here’s how to tell the difference.</p>
<p>Once you know how to classify your projects, the next challenge is keeping them on track. </p>
<p>Even the best-planned SEO initiatives can fall apart without structure, communication, and accountability – that’s where strong project management comes in.</p>
<p>In short, balance isn’t static. Your mix will shift with cycles, resources, and company goals.</p>
<p>And that’s the point – every framework, formula, and prioritization method only works if you apply it with discipline.</p>
<p>As 2026 approaches, building an SEO strategy is less about chasing the latest tool or tactic and more about discipline.</p>
<p>The exact mix will shift with your company’s cycle, but the principle stays the same:</p>
<p>Balance takes focus, patience, and rigor. </p>
<p>In 2026, that discipline will separate the teams that just talk strategy from those that actually move the needle.</p>
