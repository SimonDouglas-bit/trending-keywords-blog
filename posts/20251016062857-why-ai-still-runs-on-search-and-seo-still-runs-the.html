<p>When marketing history looks back on 2025, it will mark the year AI truly hit the road.</p>
<p>Google has used AI in search for years – RankBrain, BERT, Smart Bidding, RSAs, Performance Max, etc.</p>
<p>But this year, it’s everywhere. From boardrooms to one-person shops, everyone’s asking how to use it and avoid being left behind.</p>
<p>Amid the noise, facts have blurred into hype. </p>
<p>I’ve heard it repeatedly from new clients: “SEO is dead. Don’t talk to us about SEO – talk to us about AI.”</p>
<p>Fittingly, in this spooky season, SEO has “died” more times than every horror villain combined – yet it always comes back.</p>
<p>AI is a true game-changer, but the hype is louder than anything I’ve seen in 25 years of digital marketing. It feeds our urge to fear what’s new and chase what’s shiny.</p>
<p>Let’s take a breath. SEO isn’t dead – far from it. </p>
<p>Focusing on SEO is still the smartest way to succeed in the age of AI.</p>
<p>AI tools are trained on massive datasets – a process that’s complex, expensive, and resource-intensive. </p>
<p>In the case of ChatGPT, the most recent training run was more than a year ago, in September 2024.</p>
<p>That means the system’s knowledge is already over 12 months out of date. </p>
<p>Anything that happened after that cutoff effectively doesn’t exist to these “intelligent” models. </p>
<p>While that’s fine for answering historical questions, it’s a problem for marketers who need real-time information. </p>
<p>Dig deeper: AI search is booming, but SEO is still not dead</p>
<p>To deliver up-to-date answers, AI tools must supplement what they already know with what’s happening right now. </p>
<p>They do this through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which allows models to pull current data from the web and weave it into responses.</p>
<p>In other words, when ChatGPT “checks the web,” it’s using search results to inform its answers. </p>
<p>For any question that requires current knowledge, AI systems rely on search – just like the rest of us. </p>
<p>And that means strong search visibility still feeds visibility in AI.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How generative information retrieval is reshaping search</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>A clear behavioral shift is underway.</p>
<p>Traditional search often feels like panning for gold.</p>
<p>You type a short, generic query like “plumbers near me,” then do the hard work of:</p>
<p>It’s tedious and easy to get wrong.</p>
<p>AI tools change that. Ask a more detailed question, and they’ll search, sift, and structure the information for you.</p>
<p>Take my own experience: I’ve had my share of disappointing plumbers and roofers who looked fine on Google but weren’t.</p>
<p>When I asked an AI tool for help, it spent a moment “searching the web,” then suggested several reputable companies to check out.</p>
<p>That next step – verifying those names – took me right back to search, often through brand queries, for a closer look. </p>
<p>The user journey isn’t disappearing; it’s evolving. </p>
<p>Every few years, digital marketing discovers a new frontier: search, social, mobile, video, voice, TikTok, programmatic – and now, AI. </p>
<p>Each wave sparks a tactical arms race to win new ground, often at the expense of what already works.</p>
<p>SEO has weathered many of these shifts. </p>
<p>Despite declining traffic, it’s entering an era of normalization. </p>
<p>The old tricks don’t work anymore, and that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>SEO isn’t reinventing itself so much as evolving – even AI Overviews are simply an extension of featured snippets.</p>
<p>What works today is the basics done right: </p>
<p>The challenge is tuning out the noise. </p>
<p>The AI hype – the threats, the promises, the shiny newness – plays directly to human nature: our fear of the unknown and attraction to what’s novel.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t treat AI as a new battlefield to conquer but as a multiplier that helps refine and scale what already works. </p>
<p>Use AI to enhance your marketing, not replace its fundamentals.</p>
<p>And those fundamentals always come back to one thing: search. </p>
<p>How do we improve it? SEO.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: SEO in the age of AI: Becoming the trusted answer</p>
<p>There’s some good news.</p>
<p>AI is essentially the distillation of everything else – a super-powered autocomplete on steroids with Incredible Hulk-level energy.</p>
<p>Search engines remain the most current and complete map of your business, brand, and marketing environment. </p>
<p>SEO is the method that ensures your business presents itself clearly and comprehensively. </p>
<p>AI then draws from that clarity to represent you in the right light.</p>
<p>Unlike the unknowns of AI, the path to strong SEO is well defined. </p>
<p>Don’t view AI as a replacement for SEO or anything else you’re doing. </p>
<p>Think of it as a new layer that sits above search – one that gives users an easier way to access information about your business.</p>
<p>Double down on SEO. </p>
<p>Build a strategy, document it, and make it actionable. </p>
<p>Focus on the fundamentals, and you’ll see results — in both search and AI.</p>
<p>SEO is dead. Long live SEO.</p>
