<p>Published on October 17, 2025</p>
</div>
        Recently, there’s been discussion – and some frustration – on social media about what’s being said (and who’s saying it) about <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>, GEO, and whatever comes next.
Some of that criticism has been directed at <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">search</a> Engine Land, and that’s fair game. We’ve always encouraged open debate and multiple viewpoints about where search marketing is headed.
But I want to take a moment to clarify what we believe, what we don’t, and why our editorial approach may not <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">always</a> align with everyone’s worldview – especially in this unprecedented, transitional moment for our industry.
Search Engine Land believes <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a> is very much still a thing. As Lily Ray put it in her excellent Search Engine Land article, AI search is booming, but SEO is still not dead.
But we also believe <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a> is evolving.
The fundamentals – technical excellence, relevance, authority, content that meets human needs – still matter. They <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">always</a> will. 
<p>What’s changing are the interfaces and distribution channels through which people access information.</p>
<p>When those change, language has to evolve, too.</p>
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">search</a> Engine Land has always been a community publication. 
That means we publish multiple, sometimes conflicting, perspectives. That’s intentional. <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a> has never been a field with one single, universal truth.
<p>Disagreement and discussion make the industry stronger. </p>
<p>We’d rather foster debate than enforce a single viewpoint. Ideas sharpen and evolve through constructive conflict.</p>
You can call it AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>, GEO, AEO, LLMO, or something else entirely – the terminology is secondary. What matters is what’s happening:
Clicks and traffic have been vanishing since the emergence of AI Overviews, answer <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">engine</a>s, and other generative systems. 
<p>That’s not fear-mongering. It’s observable data. Regardless of Google’s carefully worded talking points.</p>
So the natural question becomes: What “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>” do you do when there is no more “search engine”?
<p>That’s why we’re exploring and naming this shift. </p>
Our goal is not to hype something new, but to describe an undeniable evolution in how <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">search</a> (and discovery) works.
The best practices of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a> largely carry over into AI SEO, or whatever new framework emerges:
We’ve never said otherwise. The “new” isn’t replacing <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a> fundamentals; it’s extending them.
<p>Let’s be real: truth is subjective.</p>
Two smart, experienced <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>s can look at the same evidence and draw different conclusions. That’s normal.
At <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">search</a> Engine Land, we’ll continue to publish our interpretations of what’s happening – supported by data and experience – while giving space to others who see it differently. 
<p>Disagreement isn’t deception. It’s dialogue.</p>
There’s plenty of deception and snake oil in our industry – <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">always</a> has been, always will be.
<p>That’s not caused by one article or publication. It’s the nature of any evolving, competitive space.</p>
<p>We can’t stop bad actors from misusing ideas, but we can keep trying to elevate good ones – by being transparent, evidence-driven, and open to correction when we get something wrong.</p>
Yes, we’ve published conflicting takes on topics like GEO, AEO, and the future of AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>. That’s not confusion – that’s conversation.
<p>We’re in a time of unprecedented change, and pretending everyone agrees would be dishonest. </p>
<p>We’d rather show you and all our readers the range of perspectives than withhold ideas because they don’t conform to one narrative.</p>
<p>Whether content is written by a human, an AI, or some blend of both, our view is simple:</p>
<p>If it helps someone solve a problem, learn something, or make a decision – that’s good content.</p>
<p>Humans make mistakes. AI makes mistakes. </p>
<p>Ultimately, accuracy and usefulness matter most.</p>
<p>And, as we’ve reported: People don’t really care whether content is made by AI or humans. 80% of consumers are neutral or positive toward brands using AI-generated content.</p>
As Mike King has said, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a> isn’t dead – it’s deprecated.
Google’s long-term vision has <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">always</a> been the “Star Trek” computer – a system that provides answers, not a list of webpages.
We are now dealing with information engines – not <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">search</a> engines. Thus why I half-jokingly used the term Information Engine Optimization.
We’re not there yet, but the trajectory is clear. Holding onto “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>” as if it will always mean the same thing doesn’t make sense. 
<p>“GEO,” or whatever comes next, might simply reflect a more expansive reality of how people find and interact with information.</p>
<p>Let’s retire the “GEO is for geology” jokes.</p>
<p>Words evolve. Every field goes through terminology debates – science, law, tech, marketing.</p>
<p>It’s natural, even healthy, to argue about definitions when new ideas emerge. </p>
<p>What matters is not what we call it, but what we do with it.</p>
<p>Dig deeper. Yes, GEO is happening</p>
It’s worth remembering that the term “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>” wasn’t a universally accepted term in the beginning.In the mid-1990s, when search engines were emerging, a handful of pioneers – Bruce Clay, Bob Heyman, John Audette, Viktor Grant, and others – were wrestling with the same question we are today: what do we call this new thing?
Some called it “search engine positioning.” Others called it “search marketing” or “website promotion.” Some “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">seo</a>” detractors, like Mike Grehan, pointed out that SEO is a misleading term because you aren’t optimizing a search engine. 
<p>In short, names come and go. Not everyone will be happy. </p>
But whether we call it “AI optimization,” “generative <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">engine</a> optimization,” or even “information engine optimization,” visibility is crucial, so optimization still matters for your brand or business.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">search</a> Engine Land exists to inform, challenge, and help search marketers navigate a rapidly changing world.
We won’t <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115054-arva-ai-yc-s24-is-hiring-an-ai-product-engineer.html">always</a> get it perfect. But we’ll always be honest about what we believe, transparent about what we don’t know yet, and open to diverse voices that push the industry forward.
<p>Critique makes us better. Keep it coming.</p>
