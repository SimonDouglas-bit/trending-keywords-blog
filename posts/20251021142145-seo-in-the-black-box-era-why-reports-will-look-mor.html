        Google’s quiet retirement of the num=100 parameter might look trivial to the rest of the world, but for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> professionals, it’s another step deeper into the dark. 
That small setting allowed us to see the full top 100 results at once, which made competitive re<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> and rank tracking more complete. 
<p>Its disappearance comes on the heels of Google requiring JavaScript execution for scraping (temporarily breaking many rank trackers) and alongside AI Overviews that steal clicks surface answers without disclosing sources. </p>
Piece by piece, the data we’ve relied on to measure <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> impact is slipping away.
<p>We are entering a black box era.</p>
Note: If your impressions suddenly dropped in Google <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> Console, it’s not necessarily bad news. 
Google’s removal of num=100 made the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> more human-accurate:
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> has never been entirely transparent, but it used to give us proxies and breadcrumbs – rankings, impressions, clicks – that were stable enough to build reports around. 
<p>Now those numbers are fragmenting, misleading, or vanishing outright. </p>
That doesn’t mean <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> is irrelevant. It means the way we measure and report it has to change.
<p>The loss of num=100 doesn’t just obscure rank tracking.</p>
<p>It quietly alters the way we:</p>
Before this change, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> tools could request the full first hundred results for a query, showing where every relevant page ranked. 
<p>That allowed for deeper keyword mapping and for spotting low-hanging fruit: pages sitting just beyond page one that could be optimized to climb. </p>
<p>Now that view is gone, and most third-party tools can only sample partial SERPs. </p>
As a result, the list of keywords a page ranks for is truncated, and the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> used for identifying opportunity gaps is less complete.
<p>What’s more, this change clarifies our perception of human impressions. </p>
<p>Much of the long‑tail “impressions but no clicks” we used to see were probably generated by bots, scrapers, and non‑human activity surfaced by deep‑page result views. </p>
By effectively focusing reporting on Page 1 exposure – where, let’s be honest, human users actually look – <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> Console now reflects human behavior more closely. 
The trade‑off: cleaner, human‑aligned <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>, but less visibility into the long tail we once used for discovery and diagnostics.
<p>Once reliable, it’s now fragile and expensive because tools must execute JavaScript to render modern SERPs. </p>
<p>Many providers can’t or won’t maintain full accuracy. Some abandoned the practice entirely. </p>
This makes it difficult to benchmark <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">visibility</a> and nearly impossible to compare week-to-week fluctuations without qualification. 
The cost of accurate rank <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> has ballooned, and some smaller tools are bowing out, leaving gaps in coverage.
Dig deeper: 77% of sites lost keyword visibility after Google removed num=100: <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>
Losing num=100 also changes keyword re<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> because tools can no longer show the complete tail of ranking keywords.
This means <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s lose visibility into emerging opportunities and the “striking distance” terms that once informed optimization strategies. 
At the same time, impression counts dropped and average positions shifted because many non‑human deep‑page impressions disappeared from the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>. 
<p>In practical terms, the denominator is smaller and more human‑true, so averages look better even though nothing may have moved. </p>
<p>Trend analysis needs re‑baselining, and striking‑distance workflows need new inputs.</p>
<p>Whether your site is surfaced in Google’s AI-generated answers is mostly invisible. </p>
<p>You either appear, or you don’t, with little trace or reporting trail.</p>
<p>For marketers who built careers on metrics, that lack of transparency feels like flying blind.</p>
<p>The cumulative effect? </p>
<p>Precision reporting is falling apart. </p>
<p>The dashboards we built entire workflows around no longer reflect reality. </p>
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s are still working, still optimizing, but they’re doing it through fog.
<p>This creates tension. </p>
<p>Executives and clients still want to see tidy charts of rankings, impressions, and traffic – the same ones they’ve been getting for years. </p>
<p>These metrics are familiar, and they look like proof. </p>
<p>They make complex work seem measurable and orderly.</p>
<p>Sadly, that proof is weaker than it once was. </p>
<p>A dip might not be a true performance problem, but an artifact of reporting changes. </p>
An improvement might not mean stronger <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">visibility</a>, just an altered methodology. 
<p>At best, these charts are incomplete, and at worst, they are misleading.</p>
The new challenge for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> professionals is education. 
Stakeholders need to understand that less <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> doesn’t mean less performance – it means a changing measurement environment.
<p>Instead of precision, we need context: </p>
This reframing moves <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> closer to brand strategy and communications – and further from the tidy dashboards that used to define success.
Dig deeper: Google <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> confirms it does not support the results per page parameter
<p>In the 1960s, marketers didn’t have dashboards. </p>
<p>They didn’t report keyword charts. </p>
<p>They told clients whether their brand was visible in the places that mattered – television, magazines, newspapers – and whether it was shaping perception. </p>
<p>Success was measured in publicity and reputation. </p>
<p>The work was creative, not algorithmic or computational. </p>
<p>Impact was judged by reach, resonance, and how much the audience believed what they saw.</p>
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> is cycling back. 
<p>Our job is shifting from proving keyword precision to proving presence. </p>
<p>That’s the new reporting stack.</p>
<p>For younger readers: think brand vibes over vanity metrics. </p>
<p>(Homework: binge “Mad Men” and thank me later.)</p>
If you need a refresher, start with Don Draper’s famous carousel pitch (the Season 1 finale) – the moment he turns <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> and product features into emotion and story. 
<p>That’s what we’re doing again, translating numbers into narrative. </p>
<p>We’re not selling charts anymore; we’re selling belief. </p>
The best <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s will sound less like analysts and more like Draper in full pitch mode: turning metrics into meaning.
<p>Peggy Olson would probably approve. </p>
<p>Her character bridged the gap between intuition and insight, between creative storytelling and measurable performance. </p>
That’s exactly where modern <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> now lives.
The irony is that we’re rediscovering what OG marketers knew all along – <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">visibility</a> and trust beat precision and position. 
<p>You can’t manage what you can’t measure, but you can influence what people see and believe about you. </p>
That’s where <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> is heading again.
Get the newsletter <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> marketers rely on.
Here’s what <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s should be reporting in the black box era.
Each of these deliverables shifts <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> closer to communications strategy and away from raw technical metrics. 
They prove value through <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">visibility</a>, not position.
<p>Is your brand in the Knowledge Graph? </p>
<p>Is it consistently associated with your topics of expertise? </p>
<p>Entity strength is replacing keyword rank as a core indicator. </p>
<p>The stronger the entity, the more often you’ll appear in AI-driven answers and summaries. </p>
<p>Track structured citations, schema consistency, and how your brand is referenced externally.</p>
Media mentions, guest articles, podcast appearances, and digital PR campaigns that build recognition outside of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a>. 
<p>These aren’t vanity projects – they’re signals to algorithms and humans alike that your expertise is recognized. </p>
A citation from a credible outlet can carry more <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> weight than 50 backlinks from middling directories.
<p>Screenshots and evidence of appearing in AI Overviews, ChatGPT Browse, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot. </p>
<p>Sure, it’s crude, but increasingly critical. </p>
Several tools already offer partial tracking of AI Overview appearances – <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s should be testing those platforms to establish baselines and spot patterns. 
<p>Over time, expect new tools to formalize this tracking. </p>
<p>Some of these tools can be expensive, so if you don’t have a budget, start now with manual observation. </p>
<p>You can’t optimize what you never document.</p>
<p>How often your brand is represented in synthesized responses compared to competitors. </p>
<p>This is the modern evolution of “share of voice.” </p>
<p>It’s not about who ranks first – it’s about who gets quoted when AI explains a concept.</p>
Clear author bios, first-hand experience, and citations from other credible sites that give <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> engines and LLMs reason to choose your content. 
<p>These indicators are the connective tissue between traditional E-E-A-T principles and AI-era credibility.</p>
This transition also forces <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s and PR professionals closer together. 
The earned media placements that once seemed “outside <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>” are now essential inputs for AI visibility. 
<p>Citations and mentions strengthen entities, reinforce authority, and surface your brand where dashboards cannot.</p>
It’s worth remembering that PR isn’t new to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>, though plenty of people are suddenly discovering it as a fresh idea. 
Press releases, brand mentions, and syndicated coverage have always had a role in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a>. 
<p>The early goal was backlinks: </p>
<p>Today, the value is different. </p>
<p>You still want that pickup, but not just for link equity.</p>
You want visibility, brand reinforcement, and the chance for your content to appear in AI systems’ training <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>. 
<p>Fresh, credible information is currency in this new environment, and PR remains one of the most reliable ways to mint it.</p>
The irony is that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s spent years trying to escape the fuzzy world of “awareness” that PR operated in. 
<p>We loved our charts because they looked precise. </p>
<p>Now those charts are hollow, and we’re returning to the older, messier, but more meaningful work of building reputation.</p>
<p>If this feels like a step backward, it isn’t. It’s a maturation. </p>
<p>Digital marketing has always been about bridging technology and human behavior. </p>
<p>Now that our ability to quantify is limited, our ability to influence must take over. </p>
Smart brands will adapt by blending PR’s narrative instincts with <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>’s technical rigor. 
<p>The result: campaigns designed for credibility rather than clicks.</p>
Dig deeper: Why PR is becoming more essential for AI search <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">visibility</a>
Before diving into tactical next steps, keyword re<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> itself must evolve. 
With full SERP visibility gone, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s will need to supplement Search Console with third-party datasets, paid search data, and clickstream insights to recreate a fuller view of opportunity. 
Striking-distance analysis must become probabilistic – based on blended <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> and modeled visibility rather than exact ranks. 
This shift will push keyword re<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> toward market modeling and competitive intelligence, where intuition, experience, and context matter as much as raw numbers.
<p>We can’t control Google’s opacity or AI systems’ black boxes, but we can control how we prove value. </p>
Instead of chasing precision that no longer exists, we need to return to fundamentals: authority, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">visibility</a>, and credibility.
The <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> is thinner, but the strategy is richer. 
The future of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> will reward those who think like communicators, not just technicians. 
This evolution also hands <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>s a chance to reclaim leadership: to step out from behind dashboards and back into the role of storytellers, strategists, and advisors who shape how brands are perceived.
In other words, your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> reports are about to look less like a Looker Studio dashboard and more like a Don Draper pitch – built on presence, persuasion, and proof that your brand is the one everyone else is quoting.
