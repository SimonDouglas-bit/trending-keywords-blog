<p>We looked for commonalities and differences across 10 AI Mode studies. Here's what we found.</p>
<p>I just got back from San Diego and Toronto, where I spoke at Ahrefs Evolve and SEO IRL – both of which were fantastic. A lot of people I met subscribed to the Growth Memo. Thank you all for coming out!</p>
<p>I also had the pleasure of facilitating a 3h mastermind with leaders from Redfin, Angi, Clickup, Glean and Ourplace in San Diego. If I’ll do more of these, I’ll let you know.</p>
<p>Boost your skills with Growth Memo’s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free!</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, we published the largest user behavior study of AI Mode and found groundbreaking results.</p>
<p>This week, I’m connecting the dots between 10 different studies, tests, and data sources to see what the research actually says about AI Mode – and to answer five questions everyone’s asking:</p>
<p>In this meta-analysis of the core data our industry produced about AI Mode in 2025, we’ll look at the aggregated research – all in one place. So, I’d bookmark this, as it’s likely a stakeholder is going to ask you for it soon, if they haven’t already.</p>
<p>(If I’m missing any big studies or tests here, send me a DM.)</p>
<p>Here’s what we do know for sure: AI Mode drastically reduces external clicks.</p>
<p>This is a corroborated finding across the research touchpoints I used for this meta-analysis (including studies, tests, and fresh data).</p>
<p>We live in this reality right now – and can’t afford to ignore it.</p>
<p>Organic traffic stagnation (or even traffic decline) despite ongoing organic growth efforts is the reality today … and will accelerate if/when AI Mode becomes the default Google search experience.</p>
<p>Traffic does flow in certain cases.</p>
<p>I reported last week in the Growth Memo AI Mode usability study part 2 that shopping prompts produced clicks nearly 100% of the time, while non‑transactional tasks produced almost none.</p>
<p>Likewise, Propellic’s travel study found that planning tasks kept users in AI Mode ( with ≈104 seconds of engagement), but once a decision was made they clicked out to book (spending about ≈38 seconds before the external click).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, AI Mode doesn’t just dramatically reduce clicks, it also shrinks searching sessions: Semrush saw AI Mode sessions average two to three queries versus ~5 in traditional search [3]. That means not only is there less of a chance for traffic, but there’s also likely less of a chance for visibility, too.</p>
<p>Research across our industry this year shows, at least for now, users are slow to adopt AI Mode.</p>
<p>However, Google seems hell-bent on training all searchers to head in that direction via including AI Mode buttons in Chrome and in AIOs on the SERP – even if that could mean less time for users in the SERPs or fewer ad clicks over time. In fact, the Growth Intelligence Brief #8, I reported:</p>
<p>Logan Kilpatrick, who leads the Google AI Studio and Gemini API product, shook the SEO world [on September 6] when he said AI Mode was going to become the default search experience.</p>
<p>Even though he qualified his statement shortly after, Sundar Pichai had already said the same thing on the Lex Fridman podcast back in June.</p>
<p>So get ready. All roads seem to lead to AI Mode, whether users like it or not.</p>
<p>iPullRank’s AI Mode UX study found that only 2-5% of participants used AI Mode across five tasks, while 30-47% engaged with AI Overviews.</p>
<p>And the month before they released their study, iPullRank received Similarweb data showing over 50% of users tried AI Mode once and then bounced [4].</p>
<p>When participants did use AI Mode in the iPullRank AI Mode study, they often consumed the answer, clicked nothing and moved on.</p>
<p>In addition, back in August, Aleyda Solis shared UK adoption of AI Mode slowed after user curiosity seemed to subside after the initial launch.</p>
<p>So, it makes sense why Google is slow to roll AI Mode out broadly – it doesn’t have product-market fit, yet.</p>
<p>AI Mode accuracy varies by query type. Could this be why users are slow to adopt?</p>
<p>Despite the continued risk of inaccurate info and hallucinations, several studies this year point to high user trust in certain categories.</p>
<p>Propellic’s participants rated AI Mode answers highly – average post‑task trust scores were 4.3 out of 5. Users in this study praised AI’s ability to lay out activities and hotels clearly and quickly.</p>
<p>In the Nielsen Norman Group’s (NNG) usability study – UX research that examined how people interacted with AI chats for search as a whole, including AI Mode – noted that after being introduced to AI chat, participants found it helpful for complex information‑seeking tasks. And that generative AI saved time for those tasks by synthesizing the data. [5]</p>
<p>However, participants in the NNG study still cross‑checked facts via classic search, indicating residual skepticism.</p>
<p>Other research highlights inaccuracies and gaps with AI Mode:</p>
<p>iPullRank participants searching for local news or health clinics found AI Mode results to be inaccurate or lacking specificity, so they relied on traditional sites or maps:</p>
<p>“In [the local sports and news headlines] search, many found the AIOs and AI Mode (as well as ChatGPT) to be inaccurate, less trustworthy, and not up to date, but the participants didn’t expect these sources to be timely or accurate in the first place, which is an issue in itself.”</p>
<p>In a small-scale experiment by Ahrefs, Patrick Stox created AI Mode‑generated articles on technical SEO topics that had contained factual errors (e.g., incorrect hreflang advice) and published them live to see if they could rank. The three test pages failed to appear for their target keywords, and the test suggests that AI Mode content may be insufficiently accurate for Google’s own EEAT guidelines.</p>
<p>Both AIOs and AI Mode produce synthesized answers drawn from multiple sources, and they both aim to keep users on Google. But users do interact with them differently.</p>
<p>While we found in our research that AI Overviews act more like fact sheets, where users skim to find quick information, AI Mode gets deeper engagement. Users spend on average twice as much time with AI Mode as with AI Overviews.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in iPullRank’s AI Mode study, users were confused about AI Mode vs. AI Overviews and mostly ignored the “dive deeper into AI Mode” button.</p>
<p>Setting aside the general user confusion, there are two core similarities seen across the 2025 AI Mode research and my analysis of 19 studies about the impact of AIOs:</p>
<p>The differences?</p>
<p>Yes – visibility inside AI Mode influences user decisions even without clicks. Here’s how I can answer this confidently: Several studies show that users read AI answers, examine citations and form opinions without leaving Google.</p>
<p>I get this question all the time from my clients: “If Google shows AI Mode and our clicks go away – how do we know whether what we’re doing works?”</p>
<p>Our AI Mode usability study found that participants spent 52-77 seconds reading AI answers per task and often concluded their research within the pane. Propellic’s travel research shows users spending ≈104 seconds planning inside AI Mode and then booking on an external site.</p>
<p>High trust scores (4.3/5) imply that brand mentions inside AI Mode transfer authority to those brands.</p>
<p>Participants looked at inline links, citations and product previews but rarely clicked out, unless they had a shopping task to complete.</p>
<p>We also found that brand familiarity meaningfully drives decisions.</p>
<p>In fact, recognized brands were chosen even when other options were available. Thus, being cited (even without a click) reinforces brand recall and can lead to direct visits later.</p>
<p>In short: Treat AI Mode as a branding channel. The goal is to be present where users read, not just where they click.</p>
<p>Before I dig into the holes that existing 2025 AI Mode research has yet to fill – and the work that still needs to be done to uncover repeatable, proven ways to earn consistent mentions in these features – let me be clear:</p>
<p>I’m not taking swings at any of these studies and tests or the teams that developed them. We’re all benefiting from this expensive research these teams are working hard to distribute.</p>
<p>Across our sector, I’m seeing sharp experts and colleagues work diligently to widely and freely share information, and it makes me prouder than ever to be in growth marketing.</p>
<p>It truly feels like so many of us are doing this work together.</p>
<p>But the truth is, LLMs are a black box right now. And there’s so much more we need to know.</p>
<p>While the available studies offer valuable insights, they also come with limitations.</p>
<p>Below is my quick assessment. The intention of including this here is to inspire us all to further problem solve to crack upon these vaults of information.</p>
<p>This study uses a large dataset of 10,000 U.S. queries and repeats queries across three datasets to measure volatility. It analyzes link types and overlap with organic results, providing clear metrics.</p>
<p>But the study lacks qualitative user data and does not evaluate how often AI Mode appears.</p>
<p>This research includes real‑user think‑aloud sessions with 100 participants across multiple tasks. It also provides qualitative insights into user confusion between AI Mode and AI Overviews, which is meaningful.</p>
<p>Usage of AI Mode in this study was extremely low (2-5%), making some findings thin. So, while we received some good data here about how users are searching within Google right now with these new features available, we don’t get solid information about how people use AI Mode specifically.</p>
<p>The data for these two studies is very robust. But for the AI Mode comparison study specifically, I’d like to see research on an expanded view of search intents, other than the classic 4.</p>
<p>In Trust Still Lives in Blue Links – further analysis of the UX study of AIOs I published in May – I demonstrated a clear pattern of new ways users interact with LLM-based search features to validate AI outputs.</p>
<p>We all must expand our understanding of search intent, and having the data/research that more specifically parses out intent would help.</p>
<p>I would be very excited to see a combination of clickstream data with direct observations, broken down by vertical and over time for more AI Mode insights.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t change anything about the research we’ve put out on AI Mode the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Our results were specifically limited to the use of AI mode, so I caution against applying the insights from the study beyond the tasks or features tested. Participants knew they were in a study, which obviously can influence their behavior. We also select a broad range of tasks, which covers many intents and use cases but didn’t explore all of them in depth. I hope future research can focus exclusively on aspects like local search or shopping.</p>
<p>I’d also like to replicate the study type across industry types, larger sets of search tasks by search intent, and across LLMs.</p>
<p>Of course, this is an extremely small sample; results may not generalize. But, this is an interesting test of Google itself regardless.</p>
<p>I’d be curious to test more topics, including human‑written baselines.</p>
<p>This study looked at LLM interactions overall, and it wasn’t specific to AI Mode or Google; it also was a smaller sample of 10 participants.</p>
<p>Overall, it would be interesting to test each AI-chat-based search method, including AI Mode, specifically with a larger sample size and measure differences in trust and efficiency.</p>
<p>This was limited to travel vertical, although there are insights here that can be used regardless of industry.</p>
<p>Participants were prompted to use AI Mode, which may not reflect organic behavior – especially if people are naturally avoidant of the feature.</p>
<p>The study measures citations in LLMs, not click behavior or user satisfaction with those outputs or citations.</p>
<p>Overall, I’d love to see more information about AI Mode that includes broader geographic and multilingual datasets as it rolls out more globally, along with investigation into content accuracy and user satisfaction.</p>
<p>Our industry really needs increased sample size + diversity across these usability studies, but to be honest, it’s a huge, expensive undertaking.</p>
