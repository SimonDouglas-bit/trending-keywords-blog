To find out, we analysed billions of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> and impressions from Google Search Console. Our findings are a good reminder: page one is where the overwhelming majority of clicks and impressions happen.
In August 2025, 96.98% of desktop <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> in the US happened within the top 10 results. Mobile clicks were even higher, with 97.56% happening on the first page of Google:
On desktop, just 3.03% of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> occurred outside the top 10. On mobile, that figure was even lower, at 2.43% of clicks.
Looking back over the last two years, this is a very consistent trend. Almost all <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> happen in the top 10 results, never dropping below 95.5% of total clicks:
If we remove the data for the top 10, we can see the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> attributed to lower-ranking pages more clearly.
Over the past two years, pages outside of the top 10 results have never contributed more than 4.37% of total <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a>.
It’s a similar story for mobile <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a>. Over the past two years, most mobile clicks have happened within the top 10 results, never falling below 95.63% of total clicks:
In recent months, the top ten has become even more important for mobile searchers. From June this year, we can see a reduction in mobile <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> to URLs in positions ten and beyond:
Looking at <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">impressions</a> in August, most impressions also happen on the first page of Google: 76% for mobile users and 54.29% for desktop users.
But interestingly, a large percentage of desktop <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">impressions</a> happen beyond position 30: 28.93% of all impressions.
Given that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> for URLs beyond position 30 are almost nonexistent, it’s likely that these impressions are registered by bots and scrapers.
Looking at the historical trend, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">impressions</a> for URLs in positions &gt;30 are trending upwards, while impressions in the top 10 show a corresponding drop.
<p>If this is reflective of a recent surge in bot activity, it might go some way to explaining Google’s deprecation of the &amp;num=100 parameter:</p>
There’s a similar (although less pronounced) trend in mobile <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">impressions</a> too:
Almost all <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">clicks</a> in organic search—96.95% on desktop, and 97.56% on mobile—happen within the top 10 search results. It seems likely that impressions far beyond those pages are bots and scrapers (and not real people).
