<p>Published on October 27, 2025</p>

<p>The conversation around artificial intelligence (AI) has been dominated by “replacement theory” headlines. From front-line service roles to white-collar knowledge work, there’s a growing narrative that human capital is under threat.</p>
<p>Economic anxiety has fueled research and debate, but many of the arguments remain narrow in scope. </p>
<p>However, much of this narrative is steeped in speculation rather than the fundamental, evolving dynamics of skilled work. </p>
<p>Yes, we’ve seen layoffs, hiring slowdowns, and stories of AI automating tasks. But this is happening against the backdrop of high interest rates, shifts in global trade, and post-pandemic over-hiring.</p>
<p>As the global talent thought-leader Josh Bersin argues, claims of mass job destruction are “vastly over-hyped.” Many roles will transform, not vanish. </p>
<p>For the SEO discipline, the familiar refrain “SEO is dead” is just as overstated. </p>
<p>Yes, the nature of the SEO specialist is changing. We’ve seen fewer leadership roles, a contraction in content and technical positions, and cautious hiring. But the function itself is far from disappearing.</p>
<p>In fact, SEO job listings remain resilient in 2025 and mid-level roles still comprise nearly 60% of open positions. Rather than declining, the field is being reshaped by new skill demands.</p>
<p>Don’t ask, “Will AI replace me?” Ask instead, “How can I use AI to multiply my impact?”</p>
<p>Think of AI not as the jackhammer replacing the hammer but as the jackhammer amplifying its effect. SEOs who can harness AI through agents, automation, and intelligent systems will deliver faster, more impactful results than ever before.</p>
<p>As an industry, it’s time to change the language we use to describe SEO’s evolution. </p>
<p>Too much of our conversation still revolves around loss. We focus on lost clicks, lost visibility, lost control, and loss of num=100. </p>
<p>That narrative doesn’t serve us anymore.</p>
<p>We should be speaking the language of amplification and revenue generation. SEO has evolved from “optimizing for rankings” to driving measurable business growth through organic discovery, whether that happens through traditional search, AI Overviews, or the emerging layer of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).</p>
<p>AI isn’t the villain of SEO; it’s the force multiplier. </p>
<p>When harnessed effectively, AI scales insight, accelerates experimentation, and ties our work more directly to outcomes that matter: </p>
<p>We don’t need to fight the dystopian idea that AI will replace us. We need to prove that AI-empowered SEOs can help businesses grow faster than ever before. </p>
<p>The new language of SEO isn’t about survival, it’s about impact.</p>
<p>For years, marketing and SEO teams grew headcount to scale output. </p>
<p>Today, the opposite is true. Hiring freezes, leaner budgets, and uncertainty around the role of SEO in an AI-driven world have forced leaders to rethink team design.</p>
<p>A recent Search Engine Land report noted that remote SEO roles dropped to 34% of listings in early 2025, while content-focused SEO positions declined by 28%. A separate LinkedIn survey found a 37% drop in SEO job postings in Q1 compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>This signals two key shifts:</p>
<p>If your org chart still looks like a pyramid, you’re behind. </p>
<p>The new landscape demands flexibility, speed, and cross-functional integration with analytics, UX, paid media, and content. </p>
<p>It’s time to design teams around capabilities, not titles.</p>
<p>The best SEO leaders aren’t hiring specialists, they’re hiring aptitude. Modern SEO organizations value people who can think across disciplines, not just operate within one.</p>
<p>The strongest hires we’re seeing aren’t traditional technical SEOs focused on crawl analysis or schema. They’re problem solvers – marketers who understand how search connects to the broader growth engine and who have experience scaling impact across content, data, and product.</p>
<p>Progressive leaders are also rethinking resourcing. The old model of a technical SEO paired with engineering support is giving way to tech SEOs working alongside AI product managers and, in many cases, vibe coding solutions. This model moves faster, tests bolder, and builds systems that drive real results.</p>
<p>For SEO leaders, rethinking team architecture is critical. The right question isn’t “Who should I hire next?” It’s “What critical capability must we master to stay competitive?” </p>
<p>Once that’s clear, structure your people and your agents around that need. The companies that get this right during the AI transition will be the ones writing the playbook for the next generation of search leadership.</p>
<p>The future of SEO teams will be defined by collaboration between humans and agents. </p>
<p>The future: teams built around agents and empowered humans.</p>
<p>These new teams succeed when they don’t live in silos. The SEO/GEO squad must partner with paid search, analytics, revenue ops, and UX – not just serve them. </p>
<p>Agents create capacity; humans create alignment and amplification.</p>
<p>Building the SEO community of the future will require change. </p>
<p>The pace of transformation has never been faster and it’s created a dangerous dependence on third-party “AI tools” as the answer to what is unknown. </p>
<p>But the true AI story doesn’t begin with a subscription. It begins inside your team.</p>
<p>If the only AI in your workflow is someone else’s product, you’re giving up your competitive edge. The future belongs to teams that build, not just buy.</p>
<p>Here’s how to start:</p>
<p>The future of SEO starts with building smarter teams. It’s humans working with agents. It’s capability uplift. And if you lead that charge, you’ll not only adapt to the next generation of search, you’ll be the ones designing it.</p>
