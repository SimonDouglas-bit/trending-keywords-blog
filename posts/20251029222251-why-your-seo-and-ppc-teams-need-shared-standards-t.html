<p>Published on October 29, 2025</p>

<p>Most marketing teams still treat SEO and PPC as budget rivals, not as complementary systems facing the same performance challenges.</p>
<p>In practice, these relationships fall into three types:</p>
<p>Only mutualism creates sustainable performance gains – and it’s the shift marketing teams need to make next.</p>
<p>One glaring problem unites online marketers: we’re getting less traffic for the same budget.</p>
<p>Navigating the coming years requires more than the coexistence many teams mistake for collaboration. </p>
<p>We need mutualism – shared technical standards that optimize for both organic visibility and paid performance. </p>
<p>Shared accountability drives lower acquisition costs, faster market response, and sustainable gains that neither channel can achieve alone.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in practice: </p>
<p>During SEO penalties and core updates, PPC can maintain traffic until recovery. </p>
<p>Core updates cause fluctuations in organic rankings and user behavior, which, in turn, can affect ad relevance and placements.</p>
<p>PPC-only landing pages affect the Core Web Vitals of entire sites, influencing Google’s default assumptions for URLs without enough traffic to calculate individual scores. </p>
<p>Paid pages are penalized for slow loading just as much as organic ones, impacting Quality Score and, ultimately, bids.</p>
<p>PPC should answer a simple question: Are we getting the types of results we expect and want? </p>
<p>Setting clear PPC baselines by market and country provides valuable, real-time keyword and conversion data that SEO teams can use to strengthen organic strategies. </p>
<p>By analyzing which PPC clicks drive signups or demo requests, SEO teams can prioritize content and keyword targets with proven high intent. </p>
<p>Sharing PPC insights enables organic search teams to make smarter decisions, improve rankings, and drive better-qualified traffic.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: The end of SEO-PPC silos: Building a unified search strategy for the AI era</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>One key question to ask is: how do we measure incrementality? </p>
<p>We need to quantify the true, additional contribution PPC and SEO drive above the baseline. </p>
<p>Guerrilla testing offers a lo-fi way to do this – turning campaigns on or off in specific markets to see whether organic conversions are affected. </p>
<p>A more targeted test involves turning off branded campaigns. </p>
<p>PPC ads on branded terms can capture conversions that would have occurred organically, making paid results appear stronger and SEO weaker. </p>
<p>That’s exactly what Arturs Cavniss’ company did – and here are the results.</p>
<p>For teams ready to operate in a more sophisticated way, several options are available. </p>
<p>One worth exploring is Robyn, an open-source, AI/ML-powered marketing mix modeling (MMM) package.</p>
<p>Core Web Vitals measures layout stability, rendering efficiency, and server response times – key factors influencing search visibility and overall performance. </p>
<p>These metrics are weighted by Google in evaluating page experience.</p>
<p>Core Web Vitals:</p>
<p>You can create a modified weighted system to reflect a combined SEO and PPC baseline. (Here’s a quick MVP spreadsheet to get started.)</p>
<p>However, SEO-focused weightings don’t capture PPC’s Quality Score requirements or conversion optimization needs. </p>
<p>Clicking an ad link can be slower than an organic one because Google’s ad network introduces extra processes – additional data handling and script execution – before the page loads. </p>
<p>The hypothesis is that ad clicks may consistently load slower than organic ones due to these extra steps in the ad-serving process. </p>
<p>This suggests that performance standards designed for organic results may not fully represent the experience of paid users.</p>
<p>Microsoft Ads Liaison Navah Hopkins notes that paid pages are penalized for slow loading just as severely as organic ones – a factor that directly affects Quality Score and bids.</p>
<p>SEOs also take responsibility for improving PPC-only landing pages, even without being asked. As Jono Alderson explains:</p>
<p>PPC-only landing pages influence the Core Web Vitals of entire sites, shaping Google’s assumptions for low-traffic URLs.</p>
<p>Agentic AI’s sensitivity to interaction delays has made Interaction to Next Paint (INP) a critical performance metric.</p>
<p>INP measures how quickly a website responds when a human or AI agent interacts with a page – clicking, scrolling, or filling out forms while completing tasks. </p>
<p>When response times lag, agents fail tasks, abandon the site, and may turn to competitors. </p>
<p>INP doesn’t appear in Chrome Lighthouse or PageSpeed Insights because those are synthetic testing tools that don’t simulate real interactions. </p>
<p>Real user monitoring helps reveal what’s happening in practice, but it still can’t capture the full picture for AI-driven interactions.</p>
<p>PPC practitioners have long relied on Quality Score – a 1-10 scale measuring expected CTR and user intent fit – to optimize landing pages and reduce costs. </p>
<p>SEO lacks an equivalent unified metric, leaving teams to juggle separate signals like Core Web Vitals, keyword relevance, and user engagement without a clear prioritization framework.</p>
<p>You can create a company-wide quality score for pages to incentivize optimization and align teams while maintaining channel-specific goals. </p>
<p>This score can account for page type, with sub-scores for trial, demo, or usage pages – adaptable to the content that drives the most business value.</p>
<p>The system should account for overlapping metrics across subscores yet remain simple enough for all teams – SEO, PPC, engineering, and product – to understand and act on. </p>
<p>A unified scoring model gives everyone a common language and turns distributed accountability into daily practice. </p>
<p>When both channels share quality standards, teams can prioritize fixes that strengthen organic rankings and paid performance simultaneously.</p>
<p>Display advertising and SEO rarely share performance metrics, yet both pursue the same goal – converting impressions into engaged users. </p>
<p>Click-per-thousand impressions (CPTI) measures the number of clicks generated per 1,000 impressions, creating a shared language for evaluating content effectiveness across paid display and organic search.</p>
<p>For display teams, CPTI reveals which creative and targeting combinations drive engagement beyond vanity metrics like reach. </p>
<p>For SEO teams, applying CPTI to search impressions (via Google Search Console) shows which pages and queries convert visibility into traffic – exposing content that ranks well but fails to earn clicks.</p>
<p>This shared metric allows teams to compare efficiency directly: if a blog post drives 50 clicks per 1,000 organic impressions while a display campaign with similar visibility generates only 15 clicks, the performance gap warrants investigation.</p>
<p>Reverse CPM offers another useful lens. It measures how long content takes to “pay for itself” – the point where it reaches ROI. </p>
<p>For example, if an article earns 1 million impressions in a month, it should deliver roughly 1,000 clicks. </p>
<p>As generative AI continues to reshape traffic patterns, this metric will need refinement.</p>
<p>The most valuable insights emerge when SEO and PPC teams share operational intelligence rather than compete for credit. </p>
<p>PPC provides quick keyword performance data to respond to market trends faster, while SEO uncovers emerging search intent that PPC can immediately act on. </p>
<p>Together, these feedback loops create compound advantages.</p>
<p>SEO signals PPC should act on:</p>
<p>PPC signals SEO should act on: </p>
<p>When both channels share intelligence, insights extend beyond marketing performance into product and business strategy.</p>
<p>These feedback loops don’t require expensive tools – only an organizational commitment to regular cross-channel reviews in which teams share what’s working, what’s failing, and what deserves coordinated testing.</p>
<p>Treat technical performance as shared infrastructure, not channel-specific optimization. </p>
<p>Teams that implement unified Core Web Vitals standards, cross-channel attribution models, and distributed accountability systems will capture opportunities that siloed operations miss. </p>
<p>As agentic AI adoption accelerates and digital marketing grows more complex, symbiotic SEO-PPC operations become a competitive advantage rather than a luxury.</p>
