<p>The right choice between content refreshes and new pages depends on how each option serves your audience and search visibility.</p>
<p>This week’s Ask An SEO asks a classic content conundrum:</p>
<p>“Are content refreshes still an effective tactic, or is it better to create new pages altogether?”</p>
<p>Yes, content refreshes are still an effective tactic in cases such as:</p>
<p>With that said, not every page needs to be refreshed. If there is a similar topic that will help the reader but isn’t directly related to an existing header or sub-header, refreshing the page to include the new content could take your page off-topic. This can make it somewhat irrelevant or less helpful for users, which makes it bad for SEO, too. In this case, you’ll want to create a new page.</p>
<p>Once you have the new page created, look for where it can tie into the page you initially wanted to refresh and add an internal link to the new page. This gives the visitor on the page the opportunity to learn more or find the alternative, and then click back to finish reading or shopping. It also helps search engines and crawlers find their way to the new content.</p>
<p>New pages could be a good solution for:</p>
<p>For example, a recipe site that offers a regular, gluten-free, and vegetarian option doesn’t need to stuff all three recipe versions into the main recipe page. They can use an internal link at the top of the main recipe that says, “Click here for the gluten free version,” which helps the user and lets the search engines know they have this solution, too. Clothing brands can talk about tighter or looser fits and recommend a complementary brand if a customer complains about the same thing for a specific product or brand; this can go on product or category and collection pages.</p>
<p>If a client asks if they should refresh or create a new page, we:</p>
<p>Complicated pages are ones with:</p>
<p>But knowing what you could do or try doing doesn’t mean anything if you aren’t measuring the results.</p>
<p>Depending on which one you choose, you’ll have different ways to measure the effectiveness. Here are a few tests we do with clients in these same situations:</p>
<p>The first option is to have a control group with a couple of pages or topics, and we leave them alone as a control group. We then either expand with an equal amount of new content or refresh the same amount. The control group should be about as competitive to rank as the test groups, and from there, we watch over a few months to see if the test group begins climbing or gaining traffic while the control group remains the same.</p>
<p>The second test you can run, assuming you have a reasonably reliable rank tracking tool, is to monitor how many new keywords the content group has in the top 100 positions, top 20 positions, and top 10 positions after a couple of months. If the keywords and phrases have the same user intent as the topic (i.e., shopping vs. how to do something vs. informative and educational), then it looks like you made a good decision. On top of this, look for rich results like increases in People Also Ask and AI overview appearances. This is a sign the new content may be high quality and that you made the right decision.</p>
<p>I hope this helps answer your question. Refresh when the content is outdated, could be formatted better, or because it is fluffy and doesn’t provide value. Add new pages when there is a solution for a problem or an answer for a question, and it is unique enough from an existing page to justify the page’s existence. SEO keywords and search volumes do not justify this; an actual unique solution does.</p>
