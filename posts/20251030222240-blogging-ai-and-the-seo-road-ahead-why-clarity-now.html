<p>Published on October 30, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>For years, I told bloggers the same thing: make your content easy enough for toddlers and drunk adults to understand. </p>
<p>That was my rule of thumb. </p>
<p>If a five-year-old can follow what you’ve written and someone paying half-attention can still find what they need on your site, you’re doing something right.</p>
<p>But the game has changed. It’s no longer just about toddlers and drunk adults. </p>
<p>You’re now writing for large language models (LLMs) quietly scanning, interpreting, and summarizing your work inside AI search results.</p>
<p>I used to believe that great writing and solid SEO were all it took to succeed. What I see now:</p>
<p>Clarity beats everything. </p>
<p>The blogs winning today aren’t simply well-written or packed with keywords. They’re clean, consistent, and instantly understandable to readers and machines alike.</p>
<p>Blogging isn’t dying. It’s moving from being a simple publishing tool to a real brand platform that supports off-site efforts more than ever before.</p>
<p>You can’t just drop a recipe or travel guide online and expect it to rank using the SEO tactics of the past. </p>
<p>Bloggers must now think of their site as an ecosystem where everything connects – posts, internal links, author bios, and signals of external authority all reinforce each other.</p>
<p>When I audit sites, the difference between those that thrive and those that struggle almost always comes down to focus. </p>
<p>The successful ones treat their blogs like living systems that grow smarter, clearer, and more intentional with time.</p>
<p>But if content creators want to survive what’s coming, they need to build their sites for toddlers, drunk adults, and LLMs.</p>
<p>In this article, bloggers will learn how to do the following:</p>
<p>Let’s be honest: the blogging world feels a little shaky right now.</p>
<p>One day, traffic is steady, and the next day, it’s down 40% after an update no one saw coming. </p>
<p>Bloggers are watching AI Overviews and “AI Mode” swallow up clicks that used to come straight to their sites. Pinterest doesn’t drive what it once did, and social media traffic in general is unpredictable.</p>
<p>It’s not your imagination. The rules of discovery have changed.</p>
<p>We’ve entered a stage where Google volatility is the norm, not the exception. </p>
<p>Core updates hit harder, AI summaries are doing the talking, and creators are realizing that search is no longer just about keywords and backlinks. It’s about context, clarity, and credibility.</p>
<p>But here’s the good news: the traffic that matters is still out there. It just presents differently. </p>
<p>The strongest blogs I work with are seeing direct traffic and returning visitors climb. </p>
<p>People remember them, type their names into search, open their newsletters, and click through from saved bookmarks. That’s not an accident – that’s the result of clarity and consistency.</p>
<p>If your site clearly explains who you are, what you offer, and how your content fits together, you’re building what I call resilient visibility. </p>
<p>It’s the kind of presence that lasts through algorithm swings, because your audience and Google both understand your purpose.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: the era of chasing random keyword wins is over. </p>
<p>The bloggers who’ll still be standing in five years are the ones who organize their sites like smart libraries: easy to navigate, full of expertise, and built for readers who come back again and again.</p>
<p>AI systems reward that same clarity. </p>
<p>They want content that’s connected, consistent, and confident about its subject matter. </p>
<p>That’s how you show up in AI Overviews, People Also Ask carousels, or Gemini-generated results.</p>
<p>In short, confusion costs you clicks, but clarity earns you staying power.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Chunk, cite, clarify, build: A content framework for AI search</p>
<p>A few years ago, SEO was all about chasing rankings. </p>
<p>You picked your keywords, wrote your post, built some links, and hoped to land on page one. </p>
<p>Simple enough. But that world doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
<p>Today, we’re in what can best be called the retrieval era. </p>
<p>AI systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity don’t list links. They retrieve answers from the brands, authors, and sites they trust most.</p>
<p>Duane Forrester said it best – search is shifting from “ranking” to “retrieval.” </p>
<p>Instead of asking, “Where do I rank?” creators should be asking, “Am I retrievable?” </p>
<p>That mindset shift changes everything about how we create content.</p>
<p>Mike King expanded on this idea, introducing the concept of relevance engineering. </p>
<p>Search engines and LLMs now use context to understand relevance, not just keywords. They look at:</p>
<p>This is where structure and clarity start paying off. </p>
<p>AI systems want to understand who you are and where you stand. </p>
<p>They learn that from your internal links, schema, author bios, and consistent topical focus. </p>
<p>When everything aligns, you’re no longer just ranking in search – you’re becoming a known entity that AI can pull from.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this firsthand during site audits. Blogs with strong internal structures and clear topical authority are far more likely to be cited as sources in AI Overviews and LLM results. </p>
<p>You’re removing confusion and teaching both users and models to associate your brand with specific areas of expertise.</p>
<p>Here’s something I see a lot in my audits: two posts covering the same topic, both written by experienced bloggers, both technically sound. Yet one consistently outperforms the other. </p>
<p>The difference? One shows a clear “Last updated” date, and the other doesn’t.</p>
<p>That tiny detail matters more than most people realize.</p>
<p>Research from Metehan Yesilyurt confirms what many SEOs have suspected for a while: LLMs and AI-driven search results favor recency, and it’s already being exploited in the name of research.</p>
<p>It’s built into their design. When AI models have multiple possible answers to choose from, they often prefer newer or recently refreshed content. </p>
<p>This is recency bias, and it’s reshaping both AI search and Google’s click-through behavior.</p>
<p>We see the same pattern inside the traditional SERPs. </p>
<p>Posts that display visible “Last updated” dates tend to earn higher click-through rates. </p>
<p>People – and algorithms – trust fresh information.</p>
<p>That’s why one of the first things I check in an audit is how Google is interpreting the date structure on a blog. </p>
<p>Is it recognizing the correct updated date, or is it stuck on the original publish date? </p>
<p>Sometimes the fix is simple: remove the old “published on” markup and make sure the updated timestamp is clearly visible and crawlable. </p>
<p>Other times, the page’s HTML or schema sends conflicting signals that confuse Google, and those need to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>When Google or an LLM can’t identify the freshness of your content, you’re handing visibility to someone else who communicates that freshness better.</p>
<p>How do you prevent this? Don’t hide your updates. Celebrate them.</p>
<p>When you update recipes, add new travel information, or test a product, update your post and make the date obvious. </p>
<p>This will tell readers and AI systems, “This content is alive and relevant.”</p>
<p>Now, that being said, Google does keep a history of document versions. </p>
<p>The average post may have dozens of copies stored, and Google can easily compare the recently changed version to its repository of past versions. </p>
<p>Avoid making small changes that do not add value to users or republishing to a new date years later to fake relevancy. Google specifically calls that out in its guidelines.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about what really gets remembered in this new AI-driven world.</p>
<p>When you ask ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity a question, it thinks in entities – people, brands, and concepts it already knows.</p>
<p>The more clearly those models recognize who you are and what you stand for, the more likely you are to be retrieved when it’s time to generate an answer.</p>
<p>That’s where brand SEO comes in.</p>
<p>Harry Clarkson-Bennett in “How to Build a Brand (with SEO) in a Post AI World” makes a great point: LLMs reward brand reinforcement. </p>
<p>They want to connect names, authors, and websites with a clear area of expertise. And they remember consistency. </p>
<p>If your name, site, and author profiles all align across the web (same logo, same tone, same expertise), you start training these models to trust you.</p>
<p>I tell bloggers all the time: AI learns the same way humans do. It remembers patterns, tone, and repetition. So make those patterns easy to see.</p>
<p>I originally discussed these AI buttons in my last article, “AI isn’t the enemy: How bloggers can thrive in a generative search world,” and provided a visual example.</p>
<p>These are simple on-site prompts encouraging readers to save or summarize your content using AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini. </p>
<p>When users do that, those models start seeing your site as a trusted example. Over time, that can influence what those systems recall and recommend.</p>
<p>Think of this as reputation-building for the AI era. It’s not about trying to game the system. It’s about making sure your brand is memorable, consistent, and worth retrieving.</p>
<p>Fortunately, these buttons are becoming more mainstream, with theme designers like Feast including them as custom blocks. </p>
<p>And the buttons work – I’ve seen creators turn their blogs into small but powerful brands that LLMs now cite regularly.</p>
<p>They did it by reinforcing who they were, everywhere, and then using AI buttons to encourage their existing traffic to save their sites as high-quality examples to reference in the future.</p>
<p>Blogging has never been easy, but it’s never been harder than it is right now.</p>
<p>Between core updates, AI Overviews, and shifting algorithms, creators are expected to keep up with changes that even seasoned SEOs struggle to track. </p>
<p>And that’s the problem – too many bloggers are still trying to figure it all out alone.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned after doing more than 160 site audits this year, it’s this: almost every struggling blogger is closer to success than they think. They’re just missing clarity.</p>
<p>A good SEO audit does more than point out broken links or slow-loading pages. It shows you why your content isn’t connecting with Google, readers, and now LLMs. </p>
<p>My audits are built around what I call the “Toddlers, Drunk Adults, and LLMs” framework. </p>
<p>If your site works for those three audiences, you’re in great shape.</p>
<p>For drunk adults</p>
<p>When bloggers follow this approach, the numbers speak for themselves. </p>
<p>In 2025 alone, my audit clients have seen an average increase of 47% in Google traffic and RPM improvements of 21-33% within a few months of implementing recommendations.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about ranking better. Every audit is a roadmap to help bloggers position their sites for long-term visibility across traditional search and AI-powered discovery.</p>
<p>That means optimizing for things like:</p>
<p>You can’t control Google’s volatility, but you can control how clear, crawlable, and connected your site is. That’s what gets rewarded.</p>
<p>And while I’ll always advocate for professional audits, this isn’t about selling a service. </p>
<p>You need someone who can give you an honest, technical, and strategic look under the hood.</p>
<p>Because the difference between “doing fine” and “thriving in AI search” often comes down to a single, well-executed audit.</p>
<p>So where does all this lead? What does blogging even look like five years from now?</p>
<p>Here’s what I see coming.</p>
<p>We’re heading toward an increasingly agentic web, where AI systems do the searching, summarizing, and recommending for us. </p>
<p>Instead of typing a query into Google, people will ask their personal AI for a dinner idea, a travel itinerary, or a product recommendation. </p>
<p>And those systems will pull from a short list of trusted sources they already “know.”</p>
<p>That’s why what you’re doing today matters so much.</p>
<p>Every time you publish a post, refine your site structure, or strengthen your brand signals, you’re teaching AI who you are. </p>
<p>You’re building a long-term relationship with the systems that will decide what gets shown and what gets skipped.</p>
<p>Here’s how I expect the next few years to unfold:</p>
<p>The creators who will win in this next chapter are the ones who stop trying to outsmart Google and start building systems that AI can easily understand and humans genuinely connect with.</p>
<p>It’s not about chasing trends or reinventing your site every time an update hits. It’s about getting the fundamentals right and letting clarity, trust, and originality carry you forward.</p>
<p>Because the truth is, Google’s not the gatekeeper anymore. You are. </p>
<p>Your brand, expertise, and ability to communicate clearly will decide how visible you’ll be in search and AI-driven discovery.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I want bloggers to take away from all this, it’s that clarity always wins.</p>
<p>We’re living through the fastest transformation in the history of search. </p>
<p>AI is rewriting how content is discovered, ranked, and retrieved. </p>
<p>Yes, that’s scary. But it’s also full of opportunity for those willing to adapt.</p>
<p>I’ve seen it hundreds of times in audits this year. </p>
<p>Bloggers who simplify their sites, clean up their data, and focus on authority signals see measurable results. </p>
<p>They show up in AI Overviews. They regain lost rankings. They build audiences that keep coming back, even when algorithms shift again.</p>
<p>This isn’t about fighting AI – it’s about working with it. The goal is to show the system who you are and why your content matters.</p>
<p>Here’s my advice, regardless of the professional you choose:</p>
<p>It’s never been harder to be a content creator, but it’s never been more possible to build something that lasts. </p>
<p>The blogs that survive the next five years will be organized, human, and clear.</p>
<p>The future of blogging belongs to the creators who embrace clarity over chaos. AI won’t erase the human voice – it’ll amplify the ones that are worth hearing. </p>
<p>Here’s to raised voices and future success. Good luck out there.</p>
