<p>Published on October 31, 2025</p>

<p>FAQ schema is no longer a quick SEO win. </p>
<p>In August 2023, Google reduced the visibility of FAQ rich results in search, restricting them to authoritative government and health websites.</p>
<p>The update effectively rendered the tactic useless for marketers who once relied on it to expand their SERP real estate. </p>
<p>Google also clarified that FAQPage markup should never be used for advertising or promotional purposes. It belongs only on genuine FAQ pages created to answer user questions. </p>
<p>For years, many SEOs – including myself – added structured FAQ data to marketing pages as a best practice. It’s time to rethink that habit.</p>
<p>Google’s shifting guidance isn’t new. Once-popular tactics, such as directory submissions, were also encouraged but later abandoned. </p>
<p>FAQ schema is simply the latest reminder that even trusted SEO strategies can turn obsolete overnight.</p>
<p>SEO often feels like running a race where the course keeps changing. </p>
<p>Just as marketers adapted to the loss of FAQ rich results, AI is reshaping how questions and answers surface in search.</p>
<p>The “add FAQs everywhere” era is over, but the Q&amp;A format still matters – especially as AI-driven search begins to rely on structured, factual answers.</p>
<p>Large language models rely on clear, structured information to generate responses. </p>
<p>If your site isn’t providing direct, factual answers to user questions, you risk being invisible in AI-powered search results.</p>
<p>The challenge is knowing where FAQ content still fits – and how to structure it for both people and machines.</p>
<p>Add Q&amp;A content to product, service, or category pages to:</p>
<p>Don’t apply FAQPage schema unless the page exists primarily to answer questions. </p>
<p>This keeps you compliant with Google’s rules while ensuring your content remains structured and readable for LLMs.</p>
<p>If you want to use FAQPage schema, create dedicated FAQ pages built around a single topic or high-intent theme. </p>
<p>Each page should present a complete list of questions and answers in full text. </p>
<p>This format helps LLMs map questions to authoritative responses and improves your chances of being cited in AI-driven search results.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to create a helpful FAQ page (with 7 examples)</p>
<p>Craft responses that are concise, factual, and written in natural language. Avoid filler or purely promotional copy. </p>
<p>AI models perform best with content that reflects genuine expertise – direct, clear, and rich with relevant entities, facts, and relationships that reinforce topical authority.</p>
<p>Google explicitly warns against using FAQ markup for advertising. Even without schema, avoid turning answers into sales pitches. </p>
<p>Focus on user value first, and let internal links or calls to action guide readers toward conversion naturally.</p>
<p>Only apply FAQPage markup when one definitive, non-user-generated answer exists. </p>
<p>If multiple perspectives are valid, use a QAPage or a long-form article with subheadings instead.</p>
<p>Validate your markup with Google’s Rich Results Test, track visibility in Search Console, and monitor how your FAQs appear in AI search tools like Gemini, Bing Copilot, and ChatGPT. </p>
<p>Even if FAQ schema no longer drives rich snippets, well-structured Q&amp;A content remains key to helping AI systems retrieve your brand’s answers in response to user queries.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to create content that works for search and generative engines</p>
<p>Need a clear view of where FAQs belong, how they should be marked up, and when to leave the schema out entirely?</p>
<p>The right placement ensures your content complies with Google’s rules while also optimizing it for visibility in both traditional search and AI-driven results. </p>
<p>This framework outlines when to apply a schema, when to omit it, and how to strike a balance between user experience and technical accuracy.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>The most effective FAQ pages share two traits: </p>
<p>Below are examples of pages that use FAQPage schema correctly to enhance visibility – and others that could benefit from adding it in a compliant way.</p>
<p>These examples follow Google’s guidelines by ensuring that FAQs are user-facing, non-promotional, and structured around genuine questions and answers.</p>
<p>These examples demonstrate that a strong FAQ page is not solely about markup. It’s about building a genuine information resource. </p>
<p>Schema should enhance an already solid foundation, not compensate for content that exists primarily to promote a product or service.</p>
<p>Many FAQ pages already meet Google’s guidelines and provide genuine user value but miss out on additional visibility because they don’t use structured data. </p>
<p>The following examples show how adding FAQPage schema – where eligible – can enhance both search visibility and AI performance.</p>
<p>The SEO strategies that worked yesterday may be restricted or retired tomorrow – and FAQ schema is only the latest example. </p>
<p>The goal now is to adapt with intention: know when to apply structure, when to simplify, and when to shift your approach entirely.</p>
<p>By creating FAQ content that serves users first, aligns with Google’s guidelines, and remains structured enough for both traditional search and AI-driven systems, you’ll stay visible no matter how the landscape evolves.</p>
<p>SEO success comes from timing, precision, and adaptability – knowing when to build momentum, when to pause, and when to change direction entirely.</p>
