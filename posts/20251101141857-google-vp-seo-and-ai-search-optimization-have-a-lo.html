<p>Want your business to show up in Google’s AI-driven results? The same principles that help you rank in Google Search still matter – but AI introduces new dimensions of context, reputation, and reasoning, according to Robby Stein, VP of Product, Google Search.</p>
<p>PR for AI.  In an interview with Marina Mogilko of Silicon Valley Girl, Stein said AI “thinks a lot like a person would,” and agreed with her assessment that you’re investing in PR not for people to see it, but for AI. Stein said:</p>
<p>SEO overlap. Stein talked a bit about how AI optimization strategies differ from traditional SEO:</p>
<p>So is it (GEO, AEO, or whatever we end up calling AI search optimization) basically the same as SEO? Stein said: </p>
<p>Tools still matter. Stein pointed to Google Trends, Ads, and Search Console as underused resources for understanding new types of search behavior.</p>
<p>Why we care. Google Search is continuing to evolve. So, too, is SEO. Even Stein seemed to acknowledge that it’s not “just SEO” that matters in the era of AI Overviews and AI Mode, despite there being a lot of overlap. Because you are no longer just optimizing to be ranked – you’re optimizing to be recommended. </p>
