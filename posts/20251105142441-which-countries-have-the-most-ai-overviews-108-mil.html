These are the top 50 countries with the biggest proportion of AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overviews</a> worldwide.
We pulled data from our search index and calculated how many keywords appear in AI Overview queries compared to regular search queries that appear in SERPs in each country. Then we created a chart showing the countries with the highest share of AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overviews</a> in their SERPs.
If you expected the US to be in the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">top</a> 10, you might be surprised. Right now, the clear leader is Indonesia, with AIOs appearing for 37.2% of all keywords, followed by the Philippines and Mexico (29.1%), India (26.8%), and Nigeria (26.4%).
The US sits in 13th position with AIOs triggering for 20.5% of all <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">queries</a>, with Canada (19.2%) and the UK (19.1%) in 17th and 18th position.
<p>And here’s the data in a sortable table:</p>
We also looked at the top 10 languages dominating AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overviews</a>. English accounts for more than 50% of all AI Overviews worldwide.
Spanish is second, accounting for 11.48% of all AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overviews</a>, followed by Portuguese (5.01%), Japanese (4.37%), and German (3.82%).
<p>Google is slowly expanding language coverage for AI Mode as well, so these numbers will likely change in the near future. But for now, we can see that English leads by a large margin — partly because most of the content AI models are trained on is still in English.</p>
