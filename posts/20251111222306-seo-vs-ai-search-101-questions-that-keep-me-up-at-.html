        Look, I get it. Every time a new <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">search</a> technology appears, we try to map it to what we already know. 
I’ve been doing <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">seo</a> for years. 
<p>I know how Google works – or at least I thought I did. </p>
<p>Then I started digging into how ChatGPT picks citations, how Perplexity ranks sources, and how Google’s AI Overviews select content.</p>
I’m not here to declare that SEO is dead or to state that everything has changed. I’m here to share the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a> that keep me up at night – questions that suggest we might be dealing with fundamentally different systems that require fundamentally different thinking.
After months of analyzing AI search systems, documenting ChatGPT’s behavior, and reverse-engineering Perplexity’s ranking factors, these are the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a> that challenge most of the things I thought I knew about search optimization.
<p>I understand PageRank. I understand link equity. But when I discovered Reciprocal Rank Fusion in ChatGPT’s code, I realized I don’t understand this:</p>
These are also <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">seo</a> concepts. However, they appear to be entirely different mathematical frameworks within LLMs. Or are they?
Google indexes trillions of pages. ChatGPT retrieves 38-65. This isn’t a small difference – it’s a 99.999% reduction, resulting in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a> that haunt me:
Maybe they’re just current limitations. Or maybe, they represent a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">different</a> information retrieval paradigm.
This one really gets me. Google links to URLs that exist, whereas AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">systems</a> can completely make things up:
Are we optimizing for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">systems</a> that might lie to users? How do we handle that?
I’m not saying AI search optimization/AEO/GEO is completely different from SEO. I’m just saying that I have 100+ <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a> that my SEO knowledge can’t answer well, yet. 
Maybe you have the answers. Maybe nobody does (yet). But as of now, I don’t have the answers to these <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a>.
What I do know, however, is this: These <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a> aren’t going anywhere. And, there will be new ones. 
The systems that generate these <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a> aren’t going anywhere either. We need to engage with them, test against them, and maybe – just maybe – develop new frameworks to understand them.
The winners in this new field won’t be those who have all the answers. There’ll be those asking the right <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115127-solving-first-order-differential-equations-with-ju.html">questions</a> and testing relentlessly to find out what works.
