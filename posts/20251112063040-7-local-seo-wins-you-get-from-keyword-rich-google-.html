<p>Published on November 11, 2025</p>

<p>Keywords in reviews are generally believed to help local rankings, although their impact is still actively debated within the local SEO community.</p>
<p>Regardless of where the truth on ranking impact ultimately lands, keyword-rich reviews can still provide meaningful value for local SEO beyond pure rankings.</p>
<p>Below are seven reasons why you should still encourage keyword-rich reviews.</p>
<p>If your reviews consistently mention a keyword related to your business, the likelihood that your Profile will get a Review justification in search increases. </p>
<p>This visibility can boost click-through rates. Higher engagement may lead to a secondary improvement in search engine rankings.</p>
<p>Google creates clickable Place Topics from keywords in your reviews. These topics:</p>
<p>Google bolds frequently mentioned terms in three review snippets on the Business Profile. This draws users searching for those terms to your Profile, hopefully increasing click-through rates.</p>
<p>The Menu Highlights are generated from customer reviews and photos, similar to Place Topics.</p>
<p>Recent analysis from Claudia Tomina showed that:</p>
<p>Google’s AI-generated business summaries pull concepts from reviews (e.g., “cozy”) to describe your business. </p>
<p>While Google’s AI summaries aren’t something you can edit, encouraging customers to include specific keywords in their reviews could influence the AI to emphasize aspects most beneficial to your business.</p>
<p>Google’s AI generates review summaries by analyzing common sentiments and tips from customer feedback. </p>
<p>If your customers mention the right keywords in their reviews, your review summary will appear more compelling.</p>
<p>Google is phasing out the old Q&amp;A section and replacing it with an AI-powered feature that pulls answers from customer reviews. </p>
<p>This means reviews with detailed info (and the right keywords) are more valuable than ever.</p>
<p>It does not make sense to directly ask your customers, “Can you please add [keyword] to your review?” It’s unnatural and weird and will leave the customer wondering what your deal is.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean you have no options.</p>
<p>To encourage customers to naturally include relevant keywords in their reviews, begin by upgrading your review request templates.</p>
<p>Miriam Ellis recently wrote a helpful guide all about how to get keyword-rich reviews, which also includes three review request templates to make it extra easy for every business owner.</p>
<p>These templates guide customers on what to say, encouraging longer, more detailed, keyword-rich reviews — and can even prompt them to add photos to their reviews.</p>
<p>Here are three of those templates:</p>
<p>By implementing a few simple improvements in your review requests, you will receive more detailed reviews from your customers, and their enhanced feedback will provide numerous benefits.</p>
<p>You may even increase your Google rankings for additional keywords, but I can’t guarantee anything. With all the other benefits, rankings shouldn’t be your primary goal anyway.</p>
