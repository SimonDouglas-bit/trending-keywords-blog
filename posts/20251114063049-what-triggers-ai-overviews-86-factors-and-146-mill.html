<p>Published on November 10, 2025</p>

<p>The number of websites linking to this post.</p>
<p>This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic.</p>
To answer these questions, we analyzed our database of 146 million SERPs and explored how often AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">overviews</a> appeared for 86 different keyword traits, from YMYL to CPC to query length.
Across our data set, AI Overviews appear for 21% of keywords. But looking at specific keyword categories, some categories have as high as a 60% chance of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a>ing an AI Overview, and others as low as 1%.
<p>All data is from desktop SERPs in September 2025. Keyword categories are derived from our internal keyword categorization systems.</p>
If you’re an Ahrefs user, you can access this data yourself. Just head to Keywords Explorer and use the SERP features filter to see all keywords that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> an AI Overview, and filter by dozens of variables like intent, volume, and growth rate:
You can also analyze any brand, website, or product’s visibility in AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">overviews</a> using Brand Radar.
Just enter your brand to analyze your mentions, citations, estimated impressions, and even share of voice across millions of AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">overviews</a>:
AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">overviews</a> appear on 20.5% of all SERPs (29,991,998 out of 146,122,391).
Put another way, most websites can expect to compete with a Google-branded, AI-generated blog post for 1 in every 5 of the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">keywords</a> they target.
We can use this rate as a baseline to see whether different keyword characteristics—like intent, length, or CPC—make it more or less likely for AI Overviews to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a>.
Here’s a chart summarising our findings. Query types with a positive difference from the baseline (i.e. bars on the right of the mid-line) are more likely to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> an AI Overview; those with a negative difference (bars on the left) are less likely to trigger an AI Overview.
99.9% of keywords that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> AI Overviews are Informational in intent. 5.5% of AIO keywords are considered Commercial, 1.2% Transactional, and just 0.1% Navigational.
Relative to the baseline rate of 20.5%, we can see that AIOs are slightly more likely to appear for Informational keywords, but vastly less likely to appear for other intent types, especially Navigational. Just 0.09% of Navigational keywords <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> an AI Overview:
76.3% of keywords that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> AIOs are considered non-branded (e.g. seo tools), with the remaining 23.7% categorised as branded searches ( e.g. Ahrefs).
AIOs are 1.9x more likely to appear on non-branded <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, triggering on 13.1% of all branded queries and 24.9% of non-branded queries in our SERP database.
Compared to the baseline, AI Overviews rarely appear for 1-3 word <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, but often trigger for 5-7+ word queries.
It seems that the longer the search query, the greater the chance an AI Overview will appear. AIOs appear on just 9.5% of single-word <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, but that figure jumps to 46.4% of all queries with seven or more words.
66.5% of keywords that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> AIOs are categorized as questions.
In total, AIOs appear on 57.9% of all question <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, while non-question queries show a lower rate of AI Overviews compared with the baseline, at 15.5%.
There seems to be little obvious correlation between keyword CPC buckets and AI Overview <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">appear</a>ance, with most hovering within a couple of percentage points of our 20.5% baseline:
Almost a third (32.3%) of the keywords that trigger AI Overviews are categorised as YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>.
Given that YMYL <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> are—according to Google themselves—deserving of extra care and attention, it seems surprising to see AI-generated answers so prevalent.
In fact, AI Overviews are more common for YMYL <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> than normal queries. 34.3% of all YMYL queries trigger an AI Overview, far higher than our 20.5% baseline. Non-YMYL queries are less likely to trigger AIOs, at just 17.2%:
All YMYL categories—Medical, Financial, Safety, Legal, and Other—show an increased occurrence of AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">overviews</a>.
This is especially true for Medical YMYL <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, with 44.1% of medical queries triggering an AI Overview—more than double the frequency at which AI overviews appear across all keywords.
<p>This has not gone unnoticed by SEOs in the healthcare industry:</p>
If we categorise keywords by the industry they belong to, we can see that AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">overviews</a> have hit some industries harder than others.
<p>Compared to our baseline of 20.5%, the hardest hit categories are:</p>
At the other end of the spectrum, AI Overviews seem unlikely to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> for other industries, especially those related to commerce and news content:
Almost all keywords that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> AI Overviews fall into the not newsy category, with just 0.2% of keywords categorised as very newsy.
Relative to the 20.5% overall AIO rate, very newsy keywords are significantly less likely to trigger an AI Overview, suggesting that AIOs concentrate on evergreen <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, not current news.
<p>As part of a bug bounty, Mark Williams-Cook found a series of query classifiers used by Google as part of their search systems. (Learn more here.)</p>
All but one of these categories (other) are much more likely than average to trigger an AI Overview. At the extreme, 59.8% of all reason <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> trigger an AI Overview, the greatest percentage of any category in this research.
AI Overviews generally don’t trigger for NSFW <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>. 99.1% of the queries that trigger AIOs are classified as not NSFW:
Only 4% of NSFW <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> trigger an AI Overview, far lower than our baseline occurrence:
Relative to the 20.5% overall AIO rate, all NSFW categories show a significantly lower incidence of AI Overviews. Within NSFW, the highest AIO rates are observed for drug <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> (12.6%) and scam queries (11.3%), though both remain well below the baseline.
AI Overviews seem unlikely to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> for local searches (e.g. dentist near me).
AIOs appear for just 7.9% of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> categorised as local searches, well below the base rate of 20.5% across all keywords, and for 22.8% of non-local queries, slightly above the base rate.
<p>Google acknowledges four types of user intent in its Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines:</p>
99.9% of the keywords that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">trigger</a> AIOs fall into the “Know” category, suggesting strong overlap between Know keywords and our definition of Informational keywords (which also account for 99.9% of AIO triggering keywords). Google seems unlikely to trigger AIOs for other intent types.
Do, Visit-in-person, and Website all trigger AIOs less frequently than the base rate, with Website <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> returning them less than 1% of the time.
The Visit in person AIO rate is virtually on par with our Local <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a> category (7.1% and 7.9% AIO rate respectively); and the Website AIO rate is identical to our Navigational classification from earlier (both returning an AIO rate of 0.9%).
It seems crystal clear that AI Overviews are designed to trigger for informational <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, particularly questions and long queries. They are unlikely to trigger for news queries, local searches, and NSFW queries.
But more surprising: AI Overviews trigger very frequently for YMYL <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115108-dear-apple-add-disappearing-messages-to-imessage.html">queries</a>, and especially medical YMYL queries. Despite obvious risks of hallucination, Google seems perfectly happy answering crucial medical queries with an AI-generated snippet.
