<p>Most of what people are calling “AI SEO” right now is just legacy SEO with new buzzwords.</p>
<p>AI SEO is different.</p>
<p>When you look at how AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and AI Mode actually source and compress information, there are things you can do that literally did not exist in the Google 10-blue-links world.</p>
<p>This article walks through those AI SEO-only tactics, backed with real data, not wishful thinking.</p>
<p>You already feel this in your numbers.</p>
<p>A few facts to anchor the conversation:</p>
<p>At the same time, the AI market is compounding at north of 30% CAGR, with estimates taking total AI spend into the low trillions by the early 2030s.</p>
<p>So the demand for answers is not going away; it’s moving.</p>
<p>Traditional SEO optimizes for documents that win clicks on a results page.</p>
<p>AI SEO optimizes for facts, entities, and evidence that win a place inside the answer itself.</p>
<p>Below are 12 tactics that exist only in that second world.</p>
<p>Traditional SEO treats a query as a single unit that maps to one page.</p>
<p>Generative engines do something very different. They break a query into a graph of sub-tasks, fetch information for each node, then recombine it. Google has been explicit about AI Overviews using “multi-step reasoning” to handle complex questions in one shot. </p>
<p>Academic work on AI SEO supports this: experiments with AI search functions demonstrate that they fan-out queries into sub-questions and then synthesize information across multiple sources, particularly for comparisons and multifaceted tasks.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move: you model that graph yourself.</p>
<p>You are not just writing for “best project management software.” </p>
<p>You are writing for:</p>
<p>Each of those needs its own atomic, well-titled, well-structured passage.</p>
<p>SEO can target a long-tail keyword cluster. It cannot explicitly optimize for the model’s internal reasoning graph.</p>
<p>Search engines do not absorb your content into their ranking brain.</p>
<p>Research and practitioner studies on AI search show a consistent bias toward earned, neutral sources like Wikipedia, government and standards bodies, and community documentation, far above brand-owned marketing pages.</p>
<p>Backlinko’s AI SEO and AI optimization work calls this out bluntly:</p>
<p>“if you want to be cited, you have to show up in the surfaces models actually scrape and trust, not just your own site.”</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>You are not asking “how do I rank this URL?” You are asking “where will the model learn the canonical version of this concept, and how can I be that source?”</p>
<p>Classic SEO mostly ranks at the URL level.</p>
<p>Generative engines retrieve at the passage level.</p>
<p>Empirical audits of AI answer engines using frameworks like AI SEO-16 show that what gets cited is not an entire page but specific chunks scoring well on structure, metadata, and semantics.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>The goal is to be the cleanest “reference paragraph” on the internet for a given micro-question.</p>
<p>SEO can help that page rank. AI SEO is about making the one paragraph the model wants to quote.</p>
<p>Generative engines need to justify their answers.</p>
<p>When researchers looked at what kinds of pages AI answer engines cite most often, they found strong positive signals for: structured data, semantic HTML, clear headings, and explicit evidence like tables and stats.</p>
<p>At the same time, hallucination studies show that models are more likely to invent details when they lack concrete, verifiable facts in their retrieval set.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>It is not enough to be true. You have to be structured in a way that makes truth easy to reuse.</p>
<p>Models are aggressively tuned to avoid “salesy” language and unsupported claims.</p>
<p>There is growing evidence that generative engines overweight neutral, non-promotional sources and downweight obviously commercial copy, especially in early stages of answer construction.</p>
<p>On top of that, Google explicitly broadened its definition of “spam” to include shallow content that brings no unique perspective or depth, especially in the context of AI Overviews.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>You can still sell. Just do not try to be both the lawyer and the judge inside the same paragraph.</p>
<p>Search engines mostly care that your page matches the query and passes quality thresholds.</p>
<p>LLMs care about whether your entity is understood and consistently described across the corpus.</p>
<p>Academic and practitioner studies on AI search show large variance in how different engines frame the same brand, with systematic bias toward well-known entities and clean, consistent profiles.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>You are training the model on who you are, not just what your title tag says.</p>
<p>Comparative prompts are where a lot of real buying intent lives.</p>
<p>AI answer engines handle those by pulling in multiple entity clusters and then synthesizing an answer. AI SEO research and observational data across tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity show that the brands that consistently appear in “vs” and “best for X” answers tend to have rich, neutral coverage in earned media and comparison-style content.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>Traditional SEO lets you fight for competitor keywords and maybe win a slot. AI SEO lets you become part of the default peer set that the model thinks about when anyone asks for options.</p>
<p>In AI search, the “SERP” is not a page.</p>
<p>It is a blend of surfaces:</p>
<p>Semrush’s AI Visibility Index work and independent AI SEO analyses both show that generative engines pull from a much more diverse domain set than classic search, with a bias toward community and documentation sources for many categories.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>You are optimizing for corpus composition, not one index.</p>
<p>One thing models are genuinely good at is snapping to structure.</p>
<p>Across multiple AI optimization case studies, content that performs best in generative answers tends to include:</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>You are giving the model something better than marketing copy. You are giving it a reusable schema.</p>
<p>An entire industry is forming around AI SEO, with market estimates projecting tens of billions in spend over the next decade as brands realize that AI search is not a sideshow.</p>
<p>That spend is not going to a single index.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>This is not about “letting models train on your content” blindly. It is about choosing where and how they encounter your version of reality.</p>
<p>Hallucination is not theoretical.</p>
<p>Benchmarks (e.g., Vectara’s hallucination leaderboard) and academic work (e.g., HalluLens and similar studies show) that even top models still produce fabricated details in a noticeable share of responses, especially for low-coverage or ambiguous topics.</p>
<p>For brands, the risk is simple: when the model does not know enough about you, it will make something up.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>You are not going to drive hallucination risk to zero. But you can move from “the model guesses in the dark” to “the model snaps to one of several consistent, well-documented descriptions.”</p>
<p>In AI search, there are three very different states:</p>
<p>Backlinko’s AI optimization research, Semrush’s AI search studies, and new academic work on AI answer engine citation behavior all converge on the same point: citation patterns are systematic and correlate with specific on-page and cross-site quality signals.</p>
<p>AI SEO-only move:</p>
<p>Traditional SEO had “impression versus click.” AI SEO has “mention versus citation,” and it is at least as important.</p>
<p>A few realities worth stating clearly:</p>
<p>You cannot fix those macro forces as an individual brand.</p>
<p>What you can do is play the game that actually exists:</p>
<p>Traditional SEO is not dead. It is just no longer the whole funnel.</p>
