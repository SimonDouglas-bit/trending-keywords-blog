<p>The weekly SEO recap covering the latest from Google and Open AI and the EU investigation into Google's site reputation abuse enforcement</p>
<p>This week’s news in SEO brings changes and questions about control.</p>
Google’s shopping AI moved from showing where to buy to completing purchases directly. Google added structured data for merchant <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">shipping</a> policies. OpenAI released GPT-5.1 with personality controls.
<p>And the EU opened an investigation into Google’s site reputation abuse enforcement. Raising the question, should one gatekeeper control how independent media funds online journalism?</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know for this week in SEO.</p>
<p>Google rolled out Gemini-powered shopping features that find products, compare prices, and handle checkout across multiple retailers.</p>
AI Mode in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> can now automate checkout on participating merchants’ sites using your saved Google Pay details, so you don’t have to manually fill payment and shipping forms.
For full details, see our coverage: Google Adds AI Shopping Tools Across <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a>, Gemini.
Key Facts: AI Mode shopping is launching in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a>. Agentic checkout works with select retailers. An AI calling feature can confirm stock, price, and availability with local stores. All features are U.S.-only and gradually rolling out.
Google’s moving from showing where to buy things to completing transactions for you. This changes what “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a>” means for ecommerce sites.
When AI Mode handles checkout across retailers, your website becomes optional infrastructure. <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">users</a> never see your brand presentation, never encounter your upsells, never make decisions on your pages. Google’s AI extracts the transaction with your site reduced to inventory management.
The local business calling feature shows where this goes. If Gemini calls five restaurants to check availability, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">users</a> never see your website, reviews, or menu.
The impact goes beyond rankings to the transaction itself. Your SEO strategy is optimized for driving traffic where users make decisions. Google’s building an environment where AI makes those decisions using your business as a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> source, not a destination.
Google launched support for merchant shipping policy structured data, letting ecommerce sites describe shipping costs, delivery times, and regional availability so they can surface directly in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> results.
<p>The markup can appear alongside your products and in relevant knowledge panels for eligible merchants.</p>
You can get the implementation details in our article: Google Launches Structured Data For Merchant <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">shipping</a> Policies.
Key Facts: Shipping policy structured data appears with eligible merchant listings, with no geographic limits. It supports flat rate, free, and calculated shipping, including delivery times and regional restrictions. Best used with Product structured data for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> results. Validation requires Rich Results Test or URL Inspection, as no specific Search Console report exists.
Shipping costs affect purchase decisions before users reach your site. Displaying this information in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> results answers a primary objection at the discovery stage.
The markup lets you differentiate on shipping when competitors don’t show it. If you offer free shipping or faster delivery, you can now surface that advantage in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> results rather than hoping users click through to find out.
Implementation is straightforward if you already use Product markup. Add the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">shipping</a> policy structured data to your existing schema and specify rates, zones, and delivery times. This is one of the more actionable structured data updates Google’s released this year.
OpenAI shipped GPT-5.1 models with customizable personality controls and improved instruction following. <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">users</a> can now adjust ChatGPT’s tone through preset styles or granular characteristic tuning instead of the previous one-size-fits-all approach.
<p>We covered the release here: OpenAI Releases GPT-5.1 With Improved Instruction Following.</p>
Key Facts: GPT-5.1 is now available first to paid <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">users</a> (Pro, Plus, Go, Business), with free access following. Adaptive reasoning optimizes processing time based on query complexity. Legacy GPT-5 models stay available for three months.
<p>You can now customize ChatGPT’s output style to match your needs, rather than editing around the default tone.</p>
<p>The adaptive reasoning means faster responses on simple queries without sacrificing quality on complex requests.</p>
<p>The three-month legacy model availability gives you time to test whether GPT-5.1 performs better for your specific use cases before GPT-5 sunsets.</p>
<p>The European Commission opened a Digital Markets Act investigation into whether Google’s site reputation abuse enforcement discriminates against news publishers.</p>
Google published a defense within hours, calling the investigation “misguided” and arguing it protects <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">users</a> from spam. We dug into both sides: Google Defends Parasite SEO Crackdown As EU Opens Investigation.
<p>Key Facts: Publisher groups in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and EU countries report significant traffic drops. DMA violations can incur fines up to 10% of global revenue, rising to 20% for repeats.</p>
<p>The investigation exposes the tension publishers face. Google’s definition of “spam” now includes their revenue model.</p>
<p>Publishers aren’t defending payday loan scams on university domains. They’re arguing that sponsored content with editorial oversight shouldn’t be treated the same as affiliate coupon pages designed purely for ranking manipulation.</p>
<p>Google’s position treats business arrangements as ranking signals rather than judging content quality.</p>
<p>If the EU forces exemptions for “legitimate” sponsored content, every spammer will dress up their tactics with editorial oversight theater. The policy only works if it draws lines. But publishers aren’t wrong to question whether one gatekeeper should control how independent media funds journalism.</p>
The news from this week tells a bigger story: <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> engines are no longer just organizing the web; they’re absorbing it.
<p>The theme of the week? Power and control.</p>
Google’s AI is deciding what <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">users</a> buy and what content deserves to be seen. OpenAI is letting creators shape the AI’s voice for the first time. And regulators are finally asking who gets to define “fair” visibility online.
As AI reshapes discovery, SEOs face the challenge of staying visible in a world where the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> interface itself has become the destination.
