<p>While some SEO influencers are selling panic and “AI-proof” gimmicks, the data from Google’s front lines tells a different, more strategic story. </p>
<p>The rapid integration of AI into search has created a wave of anxiety, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between durable strategy and distracting noise. </p>
<p>The flood of information often leaves marketers unsure of where to focus their efforts.</p>
<p>That’s the diamond in the rough that I discovered while attending the News &amp; Editorial SEO Summit (NESS), which was held online Oct. 21-22. </p>
<p>This article cuts through the hype to deliver clarity. </p>
<p>I’ve distilled insights from technical SEO experts at The New York Times, Polemic Digital, and NewzDash into five counterintuitive but actionable truths. </p>
<p>These takeaways offer a durable, data-backed framework for your 2026 SEO strategy and beyond.</p>
<p>Contrary to the widespread belief that AI Overviews are taking over every SERP, the data reveals a far more nuanced reality for timely content. </p>
<p>A detailed analysis from NewzDash found that only 1.9% of major trending news keywords trigger AI Overviews. </p>
<p>For the most competitive, high-traffic moments, traditional search features still dominate.</p>
<p>The real “surprising truth” is in the context of when and why AI Overviews appear.</p>
<p>AI Overviews are most likely to show up 6 to 9 hours after a major news event, during the “post-event window” when live interest fades and real-time coverage slows. </p>
<p>The analysis identified several key signals that increase the likelihood of an AI Overview, including:</p>
<p>This insight is critical: for now, Top Stories and real-time reporting still command the SERP during the moments that matter most, countering the narrative that AI has completely replaced traditional news results.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: AI Overview citations: Why they don’t drive clicks and what to do</p>
<p>The obsession with achieving perfect Core Web Vitals (CWV) scores can lead to diminishing returns. </p>
<p>While important, CWV is not the massive direct ranking factor many believe it to be. Its primary role is as an indicator of usability and user experience.</p>
<p>The real impact of CWV is indirect but potent. </p>
<p>Poor CWV creates a frustrating user experience. </p>
<p>Frustrated users leave or click back quickly. </p>
<p>Google interprets these behaviors as negative engagement signals, which can directly harm your rankings. </p>
<p>Think of CWV as a tool to measure and prevent user experience problems.</p>
<p>The practical advice from industry experts is to get your scores to “Mostly green.” </p>
<p>Investing significant resources to improve further is rarely worth the effort from a pure SEO perspective.</p>
<p>Engineers often obsess over minimizing every byte in the HTML, a holdover from the days of slow connections. </p>
<p>But Google’s crawlers don’t care. </p>
<p>The surprising truth is that “clean source code is not necessary.”</p>
<p>The technical reason is that Google tokenizes HTML before parsing, stripping out non-semantic tags that don’t add meaning. </p>
<p>Instead of wasting engineering cycles on superficial code cleanup, reallocate those resources to what actually moves the needle: robust semantic markup.</p>
<p>Using tags like <article>, <section>, and <nav> explicitly tells Google what each block of content represents. </nav></section></article></p>
<p>This makes indexing easier and reduces the chance of errors by clearly defining the purpose and relationship of your content.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>As search evolves from bots to large language models (LLMs), structuring content for machine comprehension is more important than ever. </p>
<p>Content chunking has emerged as a critical practice for ensuring your content is visible and usable by AI systems. </p>
<p>This structure is crucial for the operation of modern AI systems, particularly those using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). </p>
<p>RAG needs to fetch verified data to “ground” its responses, and well-chunked content makes your information a prime candidate for retrieval.</p>
<p>To make your content easy to chunk, you must provide a clear, logical structure. </p>
<p>You can do this by following two key principles:</p>
<p>A simple rule of thumb offered by Christine Liang of The New York Times is: </p>
<p>Dig deeper: Chunk, cite, clarify, build: A content framework for AI search</p>
<p>In the rush to adapt to AI, many unproven and ineffective tactics have emerged. </p>
<p>Focus on foundational principles rather than chasing the latest gimmicks.</p>
<p>For instance, LLMs.txt, a proposed standard for guiding AI crawlers, is “not a thing – at least not for Google,” according to experts. </p>
<p>Its adoption by both websites and LLMs is very low, making it an ineffective tool. </p>
<p>Similarly, tactics such as over-optimizing content with endless lists, FAQs, and aggressive front-loading are essentially a modern version of classic keyword stuffing. </p>
<p>While they may offer short-term gains, their effectiveness will diminish as models get smarter and better at understanding naturally written content.</p>
<p>The foundation of AI visibility remains grounded in traditional SEO. As Gary Illyes of Google told Kenichi Suzuki in a recent interview:</p>
<p>This is the most important statement for SEOs today. </p>
<p>It confirms that AI Overviews are built upon the foundation of traditional Google Search. </p>
<p>The path to visibility in AI features runs directly through mastering the fundamentals of SEO, not chasing shiny objects.</p>
<p>While the search landscape is undoubtedly being reshaped by AI, the core pillars of effective SEO are not just relevant – they’re more critical than ever. </p>
<p>A strong technical foundation, semantically structured content, a commitment to quality, and a focus on user experience are the principles that endure. </p>
<p>These are the signals that both traditional search crawlers and sophisticated AI models rely on to identify authoritative and valuable information.</p>
<p>In an age of increasing complexity, mastery of the fundamentals is the ultimate competitive advantage. </p>
<p>Instead of asking how to “optimize for AI,” the real task is to create content so valuable and well-structured that both humans and AI have no choice but to cite it.</p>
