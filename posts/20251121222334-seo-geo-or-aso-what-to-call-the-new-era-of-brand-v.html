<p>In June, Fractl and Search Engine Land surveyed 2,000 consumers and uncovered a startling statistic: 82% find AI-powered search more helpful than traditional search. </p>
<p>While the SEO industry panicked, thought leaders and snakeoil salesmen took to LinkedIn to lay claim to this new frontier of AI-driven brand visibility:</p>
<p>“It’s called GEO!” </p>
<p>“Oh, we use AISO! Wait, I meant LLMO now!” </p>
<p>…Or, maybe, it’s just effective SEO? </p>
<p>Industry banter aside, we’ve entered a world where old-school search and AI-driven discovery coexist – and the terminology isn’t trivial. </p>
<p>It’s the roadmap for how brands show up across fast-growing search platforms like ChatGPT, which is forecast to hit 1 billion users by year’s end.</p>
<p>To bring clarity to that shifting vocabulary, Fractl partnered with Search Engine Land to map the language of this AI-search era. </p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we surveyed marketers, scraped thousands of social conversations, and analyzed job boards to understand which terms are actually gaining traction. </p>
<p>The goal was simple: cut through the noise and uncover the labels shaping hiring, strategy, and brand visibility in the age of AI.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Marketers aren’t replacing SEO. They’re stacking new labels on it.</p>
<p>And that pattern shows up everywhere, from what people Google to what hiring managers post on Indeed. </p>
<p>Let’s drill into the findings. </p>
<p>While large datasets are essential in studies like this, it’s equally important to fine-tune the analysis by consulting practitioners who actively follow industry news and are directly involved in the work.</p>
<p>To do that, we surveyed Third Door Media subscribers on two simple questions:</p>
<p>Right away, it became clear that some terms were far more widely recognized than others:</p>
<p>Everything else slid straight into niche-term purgatory, with fewer than half of respondents recognizing them. That includes:</p>
<p>Now, usage tells the real story. </p>
<p>When respondents were forced to pick the one term they used to describe optimizing brand visibility across generative AI platforms, we found: </p>
<p>This contrast reveals a deeper tension. </p>
<p>Seasoned SEOs overwhelmingly agree that effective SEO strategies fuel AI-driven brand visibility – and 84% of marketers we surveyed recognize GEO.</p>
<p>However, only 14% actually use SEO to describe the work they’re doing to show up across chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini. </p>
<p>To put this tension in context, Danny Goodwin, Editorial Director of Search Engine Land and SMX, told me:</p>
<p>If you haven’t watched it yet, I also highly recommend Lily Ray’s MozCon talk, “GEO, AEO, LLMO: Separating Fact from Fiction &amp; How to Win in AI Search,” in which she artistically narrates how: </p>
<p>The need for pieces like Ray’s and this article underscores a bigger story than emerging industry nomenclature.</p>
<p>It signals a paradigm fracture, an industry craving new frameworks to define AI-era discovery.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: The origins of SEO and what they mean for GEO and AIO</p>
<p>Instead of examining raw search volume in Google Trends, we measured the quarter-over-quarter acceleration of searches to identify which terms are gaining traction as we close out 2025. </p>
<p>What emerged is clear: marketers aren’t searching for abstract AI jargon.</p>
<p>They’re looking for language that maps directly to execution. </p>
<p>Each acronym carries a “job to be done,” and the surge patterns reveal how teams are framing their AI-era visibility strategies.</p>
<p>While new labels spark plenty of debate, our survey and trending search data point to two clear standouts: ASO and GEO. </p>
<p>Their traction may stem from their distinct use cases, with GEO aligning more with generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, and AEO anchoring conversations around AI Overviews-style summaries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rapid rise of AIO and AISO indicates that the industry is converging on a language that blends AI, search, and optimization into something more intuitive for non-SEO stakeholders.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>If Google Trends shows curiosity, LinkedIn shows culture. </p>
<p>It’s where new terminology gets battle-tested, memed, debated, misunderstood, and occasionally adopted. </p>
<p>To determine which labels exhibit actual affinity, we analyzed 6,400 LinkedIn posts from August to October.</p>
<p>While GEO still leads in awareness (84%), usage (42%), and quarter-over-quarter search interest (up 121%), the terms with the strongest positive sentiment are surprisingly literal:</p>
<p>Generative AI platforms may be reshaping how consumers search, but socially, the concepts that resonate most are still “SEO” and “SEO with AI baked in.” </p>
<p>Practitioners aren’t falling in love with clever acronyms.</p>
<p>They’re rewarding labels that clearly signal continuity with the best practices of the discipline they already understand.</p>
<p>This reinforces the growing belief that digital marketers view AI search as an evolution of SEO, rather than a replacement for it. </p>
<p>Then there’s AISO, which plays an interesting middle role – enjoying 90.9% positive sentiment on LinkedIn, but only 46.8% on Reddit.</p>
<p>This suggests that while B2B professionals are receptive to it, wider communities are more skeptical or fragmented in their use of it.</p>
<p>When we shift from sentiment to actual engagement, the hierarchy changes again. </p>
<p>On LinkedIn, the terms that travel the farthest aren’t necessarily the most beloved – they’re the most skimmable, literal, and “post-friendly.” </p>
<p>AISEO sits at the top of the engagement leaderboard with an 8.6 out of 10 score, followed closely by AEO, LLMO, and SXO.</p>
<p>These terms behave like reach accelerators.</p>
<p>They spark fast reactions and shares, making them ideal for headlines, announcements, and POV posts designed to earn surface-level visibility.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AEO consistently drives deeper comment threads once a post is in the feed, and AISO pulls in hands-on practitioners providing tactical breakdowns more than splashy hooks. </p>
<p>Classic SEO ranks lower in raw engagement, but regains momentum when explicitly framed as “SEO with AI” or linked to templates, workflows, or examples. </p>
<p>Naturally, hot-button acronyms tend to over-index in engagement, while evergreen terms like SEO remain steady. </p>
<p>Sentiment alone isn’t a verdict, but it is a useful read on cultural comfort. </p>
<p>Use this chart directionally and weigh it alongside the fuller patterns we observed across search interest, usage, and hiring language.</p>
<p>If there’s one takeaway from the social side of the research, it’s this: SEO is still the industry’s north star, but AI SEO is emerging as the clean, “no-translation-needed” bridge between classic SEO and AI-driven discovery.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: AI search optimization? GEO? SEOs don’t agree on a name: Survey</p>
<p>For the most expansive part of our study, we analyzed 33,250 U.S. job postings on Indeed, with both short-form and long-form variants of each term. </p>
<p>And when you look at job postings – not LinkedIn echo chambers nor Reddit hot takes – the future of the SEO industry nomenclature snaps into focus.</p>
<p>Hiring managers aren’t chasing the acronym of the month. They’re defaulting to the one label that captures the full scope of AI-era discovery: AISO. </p>
<p>With 11,001 active postings on Indeed, AISO now outpaces SEO, AEO, GEO, and LLMO combined. </p>
<p>In other words, the labor market has already decided what this era is called.</p>
<p>Goodwin sees this shift as both familiar and new:</p>
<p>Three things marketing leaders should internalize immediately:</p>
<p>Hiring managers aren’t looking for specialists in one micro-framework. </p>
<p>They want people who understand how to optimize discovery across human searchers, machine summaries, AI assistants, and knowledge graphs. </p>
<p>If you want applicants to find your job listing, title the role AISO or SEO (AI emphasis), describe the responsibilities using AEO/SXO, and save GEO for internal enablement and external education.</p>
<p>The SEO industry glossary is evolving because consumer search itself has splintered across SERPs, chatbots, and social platforms. </p>
<p>But the fundamentals of building an effective inbound marketing strategy haven’t changed, and the SEO job market is expanding. </p>
<p>The good news is, you don’t need to pick a single acronym. You need a framework.</p>
<p>These terms aren’t replacements for SEO.</p>
<p>They’re scaffolding for the same work that has always driven visibility: </p>
<p>That’s what builds entity strength, brand mentions, and topical authority – the signals every search system, whether driven by ranking algorithms or semantic knowledge graphs, relies on.</p>
<p>As Goodwin put it:</p>
<p>Consistently build on these effective strategies, and your brand becomes discoverable everywhere – in AI Overviews, across LLM outputs, in search results, and throughout the social feeds and communities that shape awareness, engagement, and demand.</p>
