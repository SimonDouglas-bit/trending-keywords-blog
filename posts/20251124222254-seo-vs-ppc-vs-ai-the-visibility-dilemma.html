<p>Published on November 24, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Marketers have debated SEO versus PPC for years, usually shaped by whatever has worked – or failed – for them in the past. </p>
<p>Organic search promises compounding visibility, while paid search delivers immediate control. </p>
<p>Most teams ultimately favor one over the other based on experience, budget constraints, or a survival instinct.</p>
<p>But in 2026, this old debate no longer fits the reality of search.</p>
<p>The search landscape has shifted, and the old SEO-or-PPC debate no longer fits.</p>
<p>Search behavior has evolved.</p>
<p>Search results pages have evolved.</p>
<p>The platforms – and the machine learning driving their bidding systems – have evolved.</p>
<p>And now AI has shown up like the uninvited guest who strides in with confidence and instantly becomes the center of the room, with everyone hanging on every word.</p>
<p>The question is no longer SEO vs. PPC. We now have to factor in AI and LLMs.</p>
<p>It’s becoming SEO vs. PPC vs. AI – or something close. </p>
<p>But the real question is how to use all three to maximize and steady your visibility in a chaotic, fast-moving landscape that no marketer can fully keep up with.</p>
<p>This sits inside a bigger problem: fragmentation. </p>
<p>We have more channels, more formats, and more paths to discovery than ever. </p>
<p>Marketers are stretched thin, and the complexity can feel overwhelming. Paralysis is a natural response, but it won’t help you adapt.</p>
<p>What matters now is plotting a path through the AI storm, moving forward, and adjusting your approach to stay on course.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the choice between SEO and PPC came down to this:</p>
<p>My conclusion has always been the same: a combined approach works best.</p>
<p>The two reinforce each other because they’re part of the same channel: search.</p>
<p>Most of that logic still holds – but AI has added a third, unavoidable, and exciting layer.</p>
<p>AI is reshaping how people find, judge, and trust information.</p>
<p>Adoption is already strong in some groups, but this Christmas will be a tipping point.</p>
<p>Awareness is high, the tools are simple, and AI is now baked into the platforms people use every day – browsers, phones, search engines, and more.</p>
<p>Just as Google dominated search, AI will outgrow traditional search because it’s faster, easier, and better. It really is that simple.</p>
<p>We now live in a world where:</p>
<p>Visibility now depends on AI availability. The new brand battleground isn’t ranking but being surfaced inside AI systems. </p>
<p>If SEO was the fight for rankings and PPC the fight for placement, the AI layer is the fight for inclusion – and it may overpower everything else. </p>
<p>No AI visibility means no chance. Maybe not today, but soon.</p>
<p>The challenge for marketers is simple and uncomfortable: there is no proven playbook for showing up in AI results.</p>
<p>You can’t buy your way in (yet).</p>
<p>You don’t “rank” in an LLM response.</p>
<p>You either appear – or you don’t.</p>
<p>Our fundamental goal has changed.</p>
<p>We’re no longer optimizing only for search engines.</p>
<p>We’re optimizing for discoverability within AI systems that still rely on search results for much of the information they deliver.</p>
<p>AI may feel surprising, but in many ways, it was inevitable.</p>
<p>The modern web is exhausting.</p>
<p>Searching, scrolling, streaming, shopping, and chasing answers across phones, search engines, social platforms, ads, shopping portals, pop-ups, CTAs, remarketing, email, native ads, and endless distractions.</p>
<p>Finding what you want has become a slog. You fight through marketing traps just to reach a simple recipe.</p>
<p>The amount of junk you wade through is excruciating.</p>
<p>AI cuts through that noise.</p>
<p>Ask the question, and you’ll get an answer. </p>
<p>It feels like fresh air. But is there a cost?</p>
<p>Tim Berners-Lee – the original “web master” who essentially created the web – worries that AI could collapse the web by draining the ad revenue that keeps it running. I tend to agree.</p>
<p>In “Supremacy,” a book about the rise of today’s AI tools, the authors claim that Google had a ChatGPT-like model two years before ChatGPT launched, but held it back due to fears of lost ad revenue.</p>
<p>That’s easy to believe, and I agree.</p>
<p>Why? Because AI makes finding answers dramatically easier.</p>
<p>It will dominate because it’s simply better: less clutter, faster results, and easier refinement through conversation.</p>
<p>It’s a genuine leap forward for humanity.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Modern web marketing has become a battle of attrition.</p>
<p>Humans take the path of least resistance. We click the first few links and settle for whatever we find.</p>
<p>The old SEO joke makes the point:</p>
<p>Question: Where’s the best place to hide a body?</p>
<p>Answer: Page 2 of Google.</p>
<p>But AI doesn’t search like a human. It goes wide and deep. </p>
<p>The best answer might be in Position 10 or on Page 2 (shockingly).</p>
<p>Dozens of searches, hundreds of results, technical docs, reviews, case studies – pulled in and summarized in seconds.</p>
<p>It’s kind of wonderful.</p>
<p>With hindsight, this shift feels inevitable.</p>
<p>The web has collapsed under its own entropy.</p>
<p>The extremes of advertising and commerce have degraded it to the point where getting anything done feels like navigating a war zone of desperate tactics.</p>
<p>Something had to give.</p>
<p>AI is the new order rising from the chaos of the modern web.</p>
<p>AI has fundamentally changed the economics of both SEO and PPC.</p>
<p>To show up in AI overviews, search summaries, or assistants, your content needs:</p>
<p>The unspoken truth: AI will skip thin content and prioritize original thinking and trusted perspectives.</p>
<p>Even with the rise of AI summaries, PPC still dominates:</p>
<p>AI has disrupted plenty, but it hasn’t changed Google’s need for revenue – and that won’t shift anytime soon.</p>
<p>If anything, AI is making paid inventory even more prominent, helped along by Google’s not-so-subtle tweaks that make ads harder to distinguish from organic results. </p>
<p>AI creates a new pattern of behavior defined by:</p>
<p>SEO and PPC aren’t disappearing.</p>
<p>But they may now sit in second place as they compete with a parallel discovery engine that reshapes the user journey and entry points.</p>
<p>Most marketers still treat SEO, PPC, and AI as three competing channels. They’re not.</p>
<p>They’re three layers of the same visibility ecosystem:</p>
<p>Each layer feeds the others. </p>
<p>I began this article intending to answer the classic question: Which is better – SEO, PPC, or AI? </p>
<p>But as I worked through it, the answer became clear: in 2026, that’s the wrong question.</p>
<p>Broad guidance is always tricky, and every situation deserves context.</p>
<p>For example, in the past, if you were a small local plumbing business, I might have suggested starting with PPC while building local SEO and referral marketing. </p>
<p>Over time, you could dial PPC back and rely on SEO, with ads ready if leads slowed.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you were a college with a complicated, messy site but strong authority, you could likely stop running ads – but only if you planned, rebuilt, and optimized the site properly.</p>
<p>But now we have a third ingredient: SEO, PPC, and AI.</p>
<p>At this point, you can’t separate SEO from AI. </p>
<p>AEO, GEO – whatever label you prefer – they’re intertwined.</p>
<p>Without understanding how AI and SEO connect through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), you’ll struggle in a zero-click world where people expect direct answers instantly.</p>
<p>PPC is different. It isn’t connected to AI in the same way – yet. But that likely won’t last. Google is already folding ads into AI Overviews.</p>
<p>Optimizing for AI is an extension of optimizing for SEO. </p>
<p>It’s still early, and we don’t even agree on a name, but it’s clear that figuring out how to optimize for AI will be a major focus for SEOs – and GEOs – over the next year.</p>
<p>What I know for sure: you can’t afford to freeze.</p>
<p>We may not have the full map, but we know enough to start, and there’s plenty you can do to optimize for AI right now.</p>
<p>The strategy for 2026 isn’t just about “ranking.” It’s about “being cited.” </p>
<p>To survive the visibility squeeze, you need to optimize for the machines that read your content before humans ever see it.</p>
<p>Structure your content for AI retrieval. </p>
<p>LLMs prefer short, direct answers – two to three sentences at the top – followed by detailed context. </p>
<p>Use clear logic, bullet points, and data tables that AI can easily parse and surface in overviews.</p>
<p>AI verifies facts through entities – people, brands, and concepts. </p>
<p>Your About page, schema markup, and author bios must be airtight. </p>
<p>If Google doesn’t understand who you are, it won’t cite you as an authority.</p>
<p>AI models favor information from trusted sources: wikis, major publishers, and niche authorities. </p>
<p>Shift your digital PR from “getting links” to “getting mentioned” on the sites AI already trusts and references.</p>
<p>LLMs lean toward recent information. Update stats, timestamps, and comparisons regularly. </p>
<p>Static evergreen content often loses out to content that proves it’s current.</p>
<p>No single channel will carry you. </p>
<p>Pay for immediate visibility (PPC), build long-term authority (SEO), and structure your data for AI discovery – all at once.</p>
<p>Use frameworks like “They Ask, You Answer” to create content that meets every need of your audience. </p>
<p>Apply tools like the SCAMPER framework and the Value Proposition Canvas to explore angles and expand your coverage.</p>
<p>We often treat SEO, PPC, and AI as separate disciplines, but to users – and now to algorithms – they’re simply different entry points to your brand.</p>
<p>Modern visibility requires a defensive ecosystem. </p>
<p>You need PPC to capture high-intent demand today, SEO to build the trust infrastructure for tomorrow, and a clear entity strategy so AI actually understands who you are.</p>
<p>In the end, the best defense against AI diverting your traffic is to build a brand that both people and machines actively seek out. </p>
<p>The new reality isn’t just integration – it’s resilience. </p>
<p>The winners will be the ones who stop chasing algorithms and start building the authority those algorithms are eager to cite.</p>
