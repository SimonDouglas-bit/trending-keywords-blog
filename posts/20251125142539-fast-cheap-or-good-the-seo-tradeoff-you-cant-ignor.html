<p>Published on November 25, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>You’ve probably heard the saying: Fast, cheap, or good – pick two. </p>
<p>The concept goes something like this:</p>
<p>If you want something fast and cheap, don’t expect it to be good. </p>
If you want it good and fast, it’s going to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">cost</a> more. 
<p>And if you want it good and affordable, well, you’ll need to give it time.</p>
It’s a simple way to explain how tradeoffs work in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">project</a>s.
In <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>, these tradeoffs are especially important to understand because you’re often creating problems that will cost more to fix later.
This article looks at variations of this project management concept and how it applies to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>. 
Then I’ll explain why a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">quality</a>-first approach leads to better, more sustainable results in the long run.
The fast-cheap-good concept is a modern variation of a classic <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">project</a> management approach that shows the trade-offs involved in getting work done. 
This <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">project</a> management approach is often visualized as a triangle. The three sides are typically:
<p>The common interpretation is that you can prioritize two but the third will be constrained. </p>
<p>The tradeoffs go something like this:</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the original model introduced by Dr. Martin Barnes did not claim you could “pick two” and sacrifice the third. </p>
Barnes described time, cost, and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">quality</a> as interdependent. If you constrain one, the others are impacted. 
<p>Later interpretations produced various new iterations of the triangle.</p>
Nevertheless, in theory, using this framework helps set realistic expectations in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">project</a> outcomes.  
How does time, cost, and quality impact outcomes in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>? 
<p>For many, being able to move faster than the competition is often a differentiating factor in success. </p>
However, most know that <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> is a marathon, not a sprint.
<p>In some cases, it can be six months up to a year to see real movement. </p>
<p>For more competitive sectors, it can take years to achieve No. 1 rankings for highly competitive, revenue-generating queries.  </p>
<p>Only 2% of pages reach the Top 10 within a year, while about 73% of top-ranking pages are more than three years old, per an Ahrefs study.</p>
<p>As for No. 1 rankings, the average page in Google is five years old.</p>
<p>However, the research shows that if the page were going to rank for a “higher search volume term,” it was more likely to do so within the first month. </p>
So, how much you decide to invest in <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> can impact how quickly you want to compete. 
<p>If you’re in a competitive niche or aiming for faster results, you’ll likely need to invest in more resources upfront. </p>
<p>However, if you can be more nimble than your competition, then you have the potential to beat them in the search results even without a bigger budget. </p>
<p>Being nimble means: </p>
I don’t know any true <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> experts who charge bargain-basement rates.
The reality of high-<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">quality</a> work is that it takes skill, and paying for that skill comes at a price.
It can be alluring to buy inexpensive <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> that seems to check all the boxes. 
<p>But what you’re actually buying is an illusion. </p>
And when everything falls apart, not only do you lose the initial costs of buying cheap <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> services, but you also have to pay for recovery. 
<p>Add that to the fact that you’ll lose revenue while your visibility drops.</p>
<p>In the end, you’ll end up paying more for it later. </p>
Dig deeper: Don’t kill your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> budget, shift it
When we talk about quality <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>, we’re talking about: 
<p>There is probably more, but you get the point. </p>
Quality is essential to the success of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> because it operates in a highly competitive environment. 
<p>If you aren’t properly vetting the team that you’re hiring, you may ultimately be unhappy with the services you receive.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
Here’s how the project tradeoffs can play out in real-world <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> scenarios:
This is perhaps the most dangerous path. When <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> is sold as both fast and affordable, it usually means:
If you want expert-level <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> done quickly, it’s likely going to cost more. 
<p>This is because:</p>
If you’re working with a limited budget but still want high-quality <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>, it may be possible with the right engagement.
<p>However, you’ll need to expect slower progress:</p>
Dig deeper: Why <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> often fails before it even begins
Critics have argued that the classic <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">project</a> constraints I’ve been discussing here in this article oversimplify how projects actually function.
And this may be especially true for creative and technical work like <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>.
<p>The question is, do we really have to just pick two?</p>
I propose something different. We should make <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">quality</a> the non-negotiable starting point.
In <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>, where quality determines the ranking potential and long-term visibility in search results, it makes more sense to treat quality as the foundation upon which time, cost, and scope depend (and adjust).
A quality-first strategy helps <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> programs run faster and more cost-efficiently because there’s less waste and less rework.
With <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">quality</a> at the forefront:
The bottom line is that quality <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> is the only approach that pays off over time without costing you everything later.
Traditional project constraints show up in every <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> initiative.  
The fastest path to <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> results, though, is through quality, consistent work by people who know what they’re doing.
So if you’re weighing your options, don’t think about which element of the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> program you have to sacrifice.  
Instead, ask how you can protect <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">quality</a>, and everything else will fall into place.
