<p>Published on December 01, 2025</p>

<p>The Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP), commonly known as robots.txt, has been a web standard since 1994 and remains a key tool for website optimization today.</p>
<p>This simple yet powerful file helps control how search engines and other bots interact with a site. </p>
<p>Recent updates have made it important to understand the best ways to use it.</p>
<p>Robots.txt is a set of instructions for web crawlers, telling them what they can and can’t do on your site. </p>
<p>It helps you keep certain parts of your website private or avoid crawling pages that aren’t important. </p>
<p>This way, you can improve your SEO and keep your site running smoothly.</p>
<p>Creating a robots.txt file is straightforward. </p>
<p>It uses simple commands to instruct crawlers on how to interact with your site.</p>
<p>The essential ones are:</p>
<p>Here are two basic examples that demonstrate how robots.txt controls crawler access.</p>
<p>This one allows all bots to crawl the entire site:</p>
<p>User-agent: *Disallow:</p>
<p>This one directs bots to crawl the entire site except the “Keep Out” folder:</p>
<p>User-agent: *Disallow: /keep-out/</p>
<p>You can also specify certain crawlers to stay out:</p>
<p>User-agent: GooglebotDisallow: /</p>
<p>This example instructs Googlebot not to spider any part of the site. It is not recommended, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>As you can see in the examples above, wildcards (*) are handy for making flexible robots.txt files. </p>
<p>They let you apply rules to many bots or pages without listing each one.</p>
<p>You have a great deal of control over spidering if needed. </p>
<p>If you need to block only certain pages instead of blocking an entire directory, you can block just specific files. This gives you more flexibility and precision.</p>
<p>User-agent: *Disallow: /keep-out/file1.htmlDisallow: /keep-out/file2.html</p>
<p>Only the necessary pages are restricted, so your valuable content stays visible.</p>
<p>In the past, the Disallow directive was the only one available, and Google tended to apply the most restrictive directive in the file. </p>
<p>Recent changes have introduced the Allow directive, giving website owners more granular control over how their sites are crawled.</p>
<p>For example, you can instruct bots to only crawl through the “Important” folder and stay out of everywhere else:</p>
<p>User-agent: *Disallow: /Allow: /important/</p>
<p>It’s also possible to combine commands to create complex rules. </p>
<p>You can use Allow directives alongside Disallow to fine-tune access.</p>
<p>User-agent: *Disallow: /private/Allow: /private/public-file.html</p>
<p>This lets you keep certain files accessible while protecting others.</p>
<p>Since robots.txt’s default is to allow all, combining Disallow and Allow directives is generally not needed. Keeping it simple is generally best.</p>
<p>There are situations, though, that require more advanced configurations.</p>
<p>If you manage a website that uses URL parameters on menu links to track clicks through the site and you can’t implement canonical tags, you could leverage robots.txt directives to mitigate duplicate content issues.</p>
<p>User-agent: <em>Disallow: /</em>?*</p>
<p>Another scenario in which an advanced configuration might be needed is if a misconfiguration causes random low-quality URLs to pop up in randomly named folders. </p>
<p>In this case, you could use the robots.txt file to disable all folders except the ones with valuable content.</p>
<p>User-agent: *Disallow: /Allow: /essential-content/Allow: /valuable-content-1/Allow: /valuable-content-2/</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Comments can be a handy way to outline information in a more human-friendly way. </p>
<p>Comments are led by the pound sign (#). </p>
<p>On files that are manually updated, I recommend adding the date the file was created or updated. </p>
<p>That can help troubleshoot if an older version was accidentally restored from the backup.</p>
<h1>robots.txt file for www.example-site.com – updated 3/22/2025User-agent: *#disallowing low-value contentDisallow: /bogus-folder/</h1>
<p>Managing the crawl rate is key to keeping your server load in check and ensuring efficient indexing. </p>
<p>The Crawl-delay command lets you set a delay between bot requests.</p>
<p>User-agent: *Crawl-delay: 10</p>
<p>In this example, you’re asking bots to wait 10 seconds between requests, preventing overload and keeping things smooth.</p>
<p>Advanced bots can sense when they are overloading a server, and the Crawl-delay directive isn’t needed as much as it may have been in the past.</p>
<p>Although Google and Bing prefer website owners to submit their XML sitemaps via Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools, it is still an accepted standard to add a link to the site’s XML sitemap at the bottom of the robots.txt file.</p>
<p>It may not be necessary, but including it doesn’t hurt and could be helpful.</p>
<p>User-agent: *Disallow:Sitemap: https://www.my-site.com/sitemap.xml</p>
<p>If you add a link to your XML sitemap, ensure the URL is fully qualified.</p>
<p>Make sure your commands are correctly formatted and in the right order. </p>
<p>Mistakes can lead to misinterpretation. </p>
<p>Check your robots.txt for errors in Google Search Console – the robots.txt check is in Settings.</p>
<p>Blocking too many pages can harm the indexing of your site. </p>
<p>Use Disallow commands wisely and think about the impact on search visibility. </p>
<p>This can apply to blocking the bots that feed the newer AI search tools. </p>
<p>If you block those bots, you have no chance to appear in answers those services generate</p>
<p>Not all spiders obey the Robots Exclusion Protocol. </p>
<p>If you need to block bots that don’t “behave” well, you will need to take other measures to keep them out.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that blocking spiders in robots.txt does not guarantee information won’t end up in an index. </p>
<p>For example, Google specifically warns that pages with inbound links from other websites may appear in its index. </p>
<p>If you want to make sure pages don’t end up in an index, use the noindex meta tag instead.</p>
<p>A common misconception in the optimization world is that AI bots require their own allow directives. They don’t. </p>
<p>Most AI crawlers follow the REP, so if your robots.txt allows all bots, they’ll crawl the site. </p>
<p>If you disallow all bots, they won’t. No extra directives are needed.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it’s generally best to keep things simple with robots.txt files. </p>
<p>Updates in how they are interpreted, though, make it a much more powerful tool than in the past.</p>
