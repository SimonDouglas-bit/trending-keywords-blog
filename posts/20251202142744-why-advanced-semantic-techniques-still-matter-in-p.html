<p>Now that anyone can use AI to generate keywords and spin up a paid search campaign in minutes, it’s easy to assume the hard work is done. </p>
<p>But creating structured, scalable performance still requires a genuine understanding of how search works. </p>
<p>Techniques like n-grams, Levenshtein distance, and Jaccard similarity give search marketers the ability to interpret messy search term data, apply client context, and build reliable frameworks that AI alone can’t produce. Here’s how.</p>
<p>Think of n-grams as the “n” words that make up a keyword. For example, in the term “private caregiver nearby,” we have:</p>
<p>N-grams are useful for simplifying keyword lists. </p>
<p>This week, I restructured several campaigns with more than 100,000 search terms. Using n-grams, I was able to reduce those lists to:</p>
<p>With these smaller sets, you may find that all keywords containing the “free” unigram perform poorly, so you’d exclude “free” as a broad match negative. </p>
<p>Conversely, you may see that “nearby” performs exceptionally well, prompting you to experiment with local variations and landing pages.</p>
<p>There are, however, clear limitations:</p>
<p>Analyzing SEO and PPC data often requires reviewing huge volumes of long-tail search terms, many of which appear only once and have very little data. </p>
<p>n-grams help convert that chaotic long-tail data into clear, manageable intelligence. </p>
<p>This allows you to reduce wasted spend, identify new opportunities, and build a scalable structure.</p>
<p>With this shorter, more digestible dataset, you can rank top-spending n-grams that do not convert (your negatives) and those that do (your positives). </p>
<p>From there, build ad groups around recurring n-grams that drive performance.</p>
<p>For example, you may find that emergency-related n-grams (“24/7,” “same day,” “urgent,” etc.) often deliver higher conversion rates. You’d segment these to control them more effectively.</p>
<p>Bottom line: n-grams help you isolate themes that warrant special attention. </p>
<p>Once identified, it becomes much easier to build advanced paid search structures centered on high-impact n-grams and generate stronger ROI.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to uncover hidden gems in your paid search accounts</p>
<p>The Levenshtein distance quantifies the minimum number of single-symbol edits – insertions, deletions, or substitutions – needed to transform one string into another.</p>
<p>It may sound complex, but the concept is actually straightforward.</p>
<p>The Levenshtein distance between “cat” and “cats” is 1 because you only need to add the “s.” Between “cat” and “dog,” the distance is 3. And so on.</p>
<p>A common use case is detecting brand and competitor misspellings that appear in your search terms. </p>
<p>For example, “uber” and “uver” have a Levenshtein distance of 1, so you would confidently exclude the misspelled version from your non-brand campaigns.</p>
<p>You can apply the same logic to keyword relevance. </p>
<p>If the distance between a keyword and the search terms it matches is too high – think 10 or more – those terms likely have little in common with the keyword and deserve review. </p>
<p>A low distance, on the other hand, usually means those queries are safe and do not require manual checks.</p>
<p>After using n-grams to build initial keyword clusters, you may still end up with thousands of search terms to organize into a workable campaign structure. </p>
<p>Sorting through 6,000 unigrams manually is not an option. This is where the Levenshtein distance becomes essential.</p>
<p>The goal is to merge ad groups that target nearly identical keywords to avoid an overly granular, SKAG-like structure. </p>
<p>Too much granularity creates complicated reporting and account management, along with inefficient bidding and wasted spend.</p>
<p>Using the same dataset, calculate the Levenshtein distance between queries across different ad groups. </p>
<p>Then identify the closest keyword and ad group using a predefined threshold – for example, 3 for high accuracy. </p>
<p>This lets you consolidate keywords and ad groups safely. With a looser threshold, such as 6, you can also group or name ad groups by similarity or intent.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example demonstrating why the three keywords below can be grouped together:</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How to use negative keywords in PPC to maximize targeting and optimize ad spend</p>
<p>In PPC, you can simplify the Jaccard similarity as a proxy to understand the overlap between two sets of n-grams. </p>
<p>The calculation is straightforward: the number of common unigrams between two sets divided by the total number of unique unigrams across both sets.</p>
<p>It may sound technical, but it’s easy to visualize. Think of it as: </p>
<p>Here are concrete examples:</p>
<p>The Jaccard similarity is a useful first step for deduplicating similar keywords. It essentially bridges the gap between old phrase match and broad match modified logic.</p>
<p>But it also has limitations because it does not account for meaning. </p>
<p>In the example above, “new york” and “NYC” should be recognized as equivalent, yet the Jaccard calculation treats them as distinct. </p>
<p>To handle that level of nuance, you need more advanced techniques (which I’ll cover in a later article).</p>
<p>Consider a cybersecurity course campaign with the following top 10 keywords:</p>
<p>By combining plural and singular versions and reordered versions of these keywords, you could reduce the top 10 into a more actionable top four:</p>
<p>You could use n-grams to do this, but scaling n-gram analysis across thousands of keywords can be overwhelming. </p>
<p>A more efficient approach is to use both similarity metrics in sequence.</p>
<p>The result is a clear, compressed structure that holds up even as your search term volume grows.</p>
<p>With the right semantic techniques, you can restructure massive keyword sets quickly and with consistent, high-quality results. </p>
<p>AI can absolutely help by providing an initial summary, but you should not rely on it entirely. </p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s a classic case of “garbage in, garbage out.”</p>
<p>Broad match can be powerful, but it also introduces more noise. These techniques help you verify that your queries stay on track.</p>
<p>Use n-grams, the Levenshtein distance, and the Jaccard similarity to apply client context to raw search data and produce a stable structure that aligns with your campaign goals. </p>
<p>It can feel overwhelming at first, so here’s a summary table to close out the article:</p>
