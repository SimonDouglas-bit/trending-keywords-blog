<p>The number of websites linking to this post.</p>
<p>This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic.</p>
<p>For instance, this study of only 20 brands (narrow sample size) is proclaiming that content needs 10,000+ words to be cited by AI.</p>
<p>I’ve also seen others insist very short content (250–500 words) is the future for visibility in AI, arguing that AI models have limited context windows and prefer concise answers (they don’t).</p>
<p>In reality, it’s a chicken-or-egg situation. If most of the internet starts publishing 10,000+ word guides, that’s probably what will get cited. But they won’t get cited because they’re 10,000+ words. They’ll get cited because that’s what’s available (and what “fresh” content starts to look like).</p>
<p>But hey, don’t take my word for it.</p>
<p>In true Ahrefs fashion, we studied 174,000 pages cited in AI Overview responses to see what actually matters. Spoiler alert: there’s almost no correlation between word length and being cited in AI Overviews.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is write as much as you need to convey your topic to your human audience concisely.</p>
<p>Trim the fluff, get straight to the point, and stop chasing arbitrary word counts “because it’s good for SEO” or “because AI prefers it.”</p>
<p>The bottom line: content length isn’t a major factor in whether you get cited. Short pages (under 1,000 words), long-form guides (over 2,000 words), and everything in between can all work.</p>
<p>For each page, we stripped out HTML and boilerplate content, then measured the word count of the remaining raw text. We also tracked citation position (1–10) within each AI Overview to see whether content length affected where a page appeared in the citation list.</p>
<p>The average word count of pages cited in AI Overviews is 1,282 words. But averages can be misleading. Here’s how the distribution actually breaks down:</p>
<p>More than half (53.4%) of all citations go to pages under 1,000 words. That’s traditionally considered “short” for blog posts and website content, and well below what most SEO professionals would request in a content brief.</p>
<p>Not exactly the 10,000+ word mega-guides some are recommending.</p>
<p>If longer content doesn’t get cited more often, maybe it at least ranks higher within AI Overviews? Nope.</p>
<p>The Spearman correlation between word count and citation position is 0.04 — essentially zero.</p>
<p>Here’s the average word count by position:</p>
<p>There’s no meaningful difference in content length between the top three citation positions, though the correlation is so weak it’s barely worth considering.</p>
<p>When short content gets cited, its distribution across positions closely mirrors that of longer content.</p>
<p>For pages under 350 words:</p>
<p>Pages between 350 and 1,000 words show a similar pattern:</p>
<p>Over 95% of short content citations land in the top three positions. This suggests that when short content gets cited, it competes on equal footing with longer content for prominent placement in AI Overviews (and wins the battle).</p>
<p>Averages can be skewed by outliers. Medians give a better sense of what most cited pages actually look like.</p>
<p>Here’s the median word count by page type:</p>
<p>Only Articles and Audio have a median higher than 1,000 words. (Audio pages are typically podcast transcriptions, which can run long. For instance, a 30+ minute conversation can be over 5,000 words.)</p>
<p>The median values of transactional and utility content (such as core pages, listings, and listing collection pages) typically range from 300 to 550 words and are still frequently cited. This matters for ecommerce and other non-blog content. You don’t need a 1,000+ word SEO-optimized buying guide to show up in AI Overviews. Match the format to the intent.</p>
<p>One more note: the overall median of 1,115 words is pulled up by the heavy representation of Articles and Audio files in our dataset. The longest blog post cited was around 3,500 words, and many audio files were between 3,000 and 5,500 words.</p>
<p>However, despite what some are suggesting, we’re not seeing 10,000+ word mega-guides dominating AI citations (at least not yet).</p>
<p>Content length alone won’t get you cited in AI Overviews. So what should you focus on instead?</p>
<p>Both short-form and long-form content have their place. The goal is to write as much as you need to answer the question or cover the topic thoroughly. No more, no less.</p>
<p>Stop obsessing over word count and focus on actually answering the query instead.</p>
