<p>LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude now sit across search, content generation, and recommendations.  </p>
<p>Now, 80% of tech buyers rely on generative AI at least as much as traditional search to research vendors, according to a Responsive survey of B2B buyers. </p>
<p>This effective transfer of trust in AI discovery has become an enablement tool for B2B buyers, quietly deciding which brands get remembered and which get ignored. </p>
<p>And those decisions, once invisible, are now measurable.</p>
<p>Previsible has been studying this shift through a new lens called LLM perception drift, the month-over-month change in how AI models reference and position brands inside a given category. (Disclosure: I’m the CEO and co-founder of Previsible.) </p>
<p>Using recent data from Evertune, which tracks brand visibility within model outputs, we focused on a single case study: the project management software space, comparing September 2025 to October 2025.</p>
<p>The results show how rapidly AI brand perception is evolving, and why that volatility is about to become the next major SEO metric.</p>
<p>Evertune’s AI brand score tracks how likely a large language model is to recommend a brand without being prompted by name.</p>
<p>The score captures two things: how often the brand appears in AI responses (visibility) and where it ranks when it does (average position).</p>
<p>Between September and October, project management brands saw big swings in their scores, signaling real shifts in the AI’s internal brand landscape.</p>
<p>Some of the more striking movements:</p>
<p>Meanwhile, gains concentrated around ecosystem and enterprise-connected brands:</p>
<p>At face value, it looks like a leaderboard reshuffle. </p>
<p>But beneath the surface, the shift reflects something deeper – a measurable change in the AI’s unaided brand awareness, a drift in how the model perceives and prioritizes brands, even when nothing visible changed in the market itself.</p>
<p>The data suggests two overlapping forces driving the change.</p>
<p>Rather than declining, the category is becoming blurrier.</p>
<p>LLMs are increasingly pulling project management tools into broader conceptual neighborhoods: </p>
<p>That’s why names like Deloitte, KPMG, and Amazon rise alongside Smartsheet and Atlassian.</p>
<p>Multi-product ecosystems are gaining attention more reliably.</p>
<p>Atlassian’s +5.50 lift is a prime example: strong documentation, cross-product integrations, and high contextual density drive richer model associations.</p>
<p>Similarly, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Adobe all saw upward movement.</p>
<p>Models favor brands that live across multiple contexts. This is the same pattern entity-based SEO taught us, but happening faster and with more volatility.</p>
<p>The more interconnected the brand, the more persistently it appears in AI-generated discourse.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Alignment for LLM visibility is incredibly complex, but doable</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>The long tail continues to reveal emerging signals.</p>
<p>Brands like Celoxis (+5.17), Workfront (+2.38), TeamGantt (+0.92), LiquidPlanner (+1.40), Podio (+1.65), and GanttProject (+0.45) grew during the period.</p>
<p>This reflects how LLM fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented systems pull in broader datasets: </p>
<p>For smaller B2B brands, this is a key unlock: you can surface in model responses without dominating classic SEO.</p>
<p>Traditional SEO metrics measure what search engines decide to display. But LLMs don’t index, they synthesize.</p>
<p>That means brand memory inside AI systems is built from associations, context, and semantic density – it goes beyond authority signals or link structures.</p>
<p>The data shows these associations can swing several points in a single month, even for established brands.</p>
<p>That volatility is LLM perception drift, the difference between being surfaced consistently in model outputs versus quietly disappearing from unaided recall.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Why AI availability is the new battleground for brands</p>
<p>In our work with B2B clients, we’re increasingly tracking AI brand signal stability, the consistency of a brand’s presence and positioning across LLM outputs over time.</p>
<p>If your score fluctuates sharply, the model’s understanding is fragile, influenced by retraining cycles, data sparsity, or competitive content expansion.</p>
<p>If it remains stable, you have strong semantic anchoring: the model “knows” you belong to the category.</p>
<p>By 2026, AI brand signal stability will sit next to share of voice and keyword rankings as a core visibility metric.</p>
<p>What’s happening in project management is also happening across different verticals – from CRM to HR tech, analytics, cybersecurity, and every other B2B category.</p>
<p>LLMs are constantly recalibrating which brands belong in which contexts.</p>
<p>As models reinterpret category boundaries, they also reshape buying journeys. </p>
<p>A small dip or surge in model attention can shift which brands appear in summaries, comparisons, and decision-support workflows.</p>
<p>What looks like a few points of movement today is a glimpse into the next marketing battlefield: AI memory.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: LLM perception match: The hurdle before fanout and why it matters</p>
<p>This shift represents the natural evolution of SEO, moving from optimizing for search indices to optimizing for model memory. </p>
<p>The focus is increasingly on:</p>
<p>We’re moving from “How do we rank higher?” to “How do we make sure AI responds correctly?”</p>
<p>That requires new tools, new data pipelines, and a mindset shift: treating LLMs as dynamic perception systems, not static endpoints.</p>
<p>Evertune’s latest dataset reveals something bigger than the month-to-month shifts of Asana, Trello, or Monday.com. </p>
<p>It captures the early signs of how quickly an AI system’s sense of a category can change. </p>
<p>These shifts are now visible enough to track, steady enough to analyze, and influential enough that marketing teams will soon watch them as closely as any core marketing metric.</p>
<p>By 2026, a brand’s presence inside AI-generated summaries and comparisons will shape decision-making more than pageviews or clicks ever did. </p>
<p>Companies that track how they show up in these model-driven moments – and learn to strengthen those signals – will gain a real edge as AI becomes the primary layer of digital research.</p>
