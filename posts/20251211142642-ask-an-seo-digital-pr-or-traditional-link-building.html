        This Ask an SEO highlights the shift from <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a> quantity to meaningful PR coverage that drives real customers and brand demand.
<p>This week’s ask an SEO question is:</p>
“Should SEOs be focusing more on digital PR than traditional <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a> building?”
Digital PR is synonymous with <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a> building at this point as SEO’s needed a new way to package and resell the same service. Actual PR work will always be more valuable than link building because PR, whether digital or traditional, focuses on a core audience of customers and reaching specific demographics. This adds value to a business and drives revenue.
With that said, here’s how I’d define digital PR vs. <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a> building if a client asked what the difference is.
Digital PR is always going to be better than <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a> building because you’re treating the technique as a business and not a scheme to try and game the rankings. Link building became a bad practice years ago as links became less relevant, they are still important, so I want to ensure that isn’t taken out of context, and we stopped doing link building completely. Quality content attracts links naturally, including media mentions. When this happens in a natural way, the website will begin rising as the site has a lot of value for users, and search engines can tell when the site is quality.
If you’re building <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a>s without evaluating the impact they have traffic and sales-wise, you’re likely setting your site up for failure. Getting a ton of links, just like creating content in mass with AI/LLMs or article spinners, can grow a site quickly. That URL/domain can then burn to the ground equally as fast.
That’s why when we purchase a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a>, an advertorial, or we’re doing a partnership, we always ask ourselves the following questions:
If the answer is yes to these four, then we’re good to go with the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a>. The active audience on the website and people returning by brand name means there is an audience that trusts them for information. If the readership, visitors, or customers are similar or the same demographics as our user base, then it makes sense we’d want to be in front of them where they go for information.
We may have knowledge that is helpful to the user, but if it is not on topic within the post, there is no reason for them to come through and use our services, buy our products, or subscribe to our newsletters. Instead, we’ll wait until there is a fit, so there is a direct “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a>” between the content we’re contributing, or being an expert on, and our website.
For the last question, our goal is always traffic and customer acquisition, not getting a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a>. The website owner controls this, and if they want to follow Google’s best practices (which we obviously recommend doing), we will still be happy if they mark it as sponsored or nofollow. This is the most important of the questions. Building links to game the SERPs is a bad idea; building a brand that people search for by name will overpower any link any day of the week. This is always our goal when it comes to Digital PR and link building. Driving that branded search.
So, that begs the question, where do we go for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">digital</a> PR?
When we’re about to start a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">digital</a> PR campaign, we create lists of the following targets to reach out to.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115121-things-weve-learned-about-building-products.html">link</a> building is not dead by any means; links still matter. You just don’t need to build them anymore. Focus on quality where an active audience is and where you have a chance at getting traffic and revenue. This is what will move the needle for the long run and help you grow in SERPs that matter.
