<p>Google Search’s Danny Sullivan and John Mueller pushed back again on the idea that brands need a separate AI SEO strategy during the latest Search Off the Record episode.</p>
<p>Sullivan’s point is simple: the acronyms keep changing (GEO, AEO, etc.), but the advice doesn’t: Write for humans, not for ranking systems, whether those systems are traditional search or LLM-powered experiences.</p>
<p>Why we care. As AI search grows, a lot of publishers and SEOs are feeling pressured to try something new. Google’s take: chasing AI tricks can actually backfire and distract you from making content people actually like.</p>
<p>Google says the north star hasn’t moved. Sullivan said Google aims to reward content made for people, not for search algorithms or for LLMs. If you’re already doing that, he said, you’re “ahead” as formats continue to shift.</p>

<p>Structured data still matters. They also said structured data helps, but it isn’t decisive. Sullivan said it’s not “structured data and you win AI.” It simply supports how systems understand and present content, just as it already does across Search features.</p>
<p>Focus on quality clicks. Google is seeing that traffic from AI formats can arrive more engaged, such as spending more time on-site. His hypothesis is that AI results create better contextual awareness. Users click when they are more confident that the result matches their intent.</p>
<p>About query fan-out. They explained why “I rank in blue links but not in AI Overviews” is a flawed comparison:</p>
<p>Clients still want “the new thing.” Sullivan acknowledged the real-world challenge: Clients still demand “AI optimization” as a separate service.</p>
<p>What to do now, according to Google. Based on the conversation, Google’s “SEO checklist” looks something like this:</p>
