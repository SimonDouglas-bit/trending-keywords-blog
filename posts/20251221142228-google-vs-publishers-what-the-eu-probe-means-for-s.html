<p>In one of the most consequential regulatory moves yet for the future of search, the European Commission has launched a formal antitrust investigation into Google. </p>
<p>At the center of the complaint is Google’s use of publisher content to train and power AI Overviews and other generative AI features – while potentially diverting traffic away from original sources.</p>
<p>For anyone working in SEO, content strategy, or brand visibility, the implications are immediate. </p>
<p>Is Google crossing a line by repurposing publisher content for AI-generated answers, or is this simply the cost of participating in an open, crawlable web?</p>
<p>With regulators now stepping in, the industry is being compelled to reassess how machine-readable content is used, managed, and valued – and what it may cost brands, publishers, and agencies if regulation fails to keep pace with innovation.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s happening, why it matters, and how the industry is already responding.</p>
<p>This EU move comes amid a growing wave of lawsuits and policy disputes over AI training data, from high-profile publisher cases against OpenAI and others to Penske Media’s recent antitrust suit targeting Google’s AI products. </p>
<p>Publishers increasingly describe Google’s approach as a forced choice: accept unlicensed use of their content for AI training and answers, or risk losing critical search traffic.</p>
<p>At the same time, technical controls such as robots.txt directives, Google-Extended, and emerging noai and nopreview meta conventions reflect an industry trying to regain control over a web that was never designed for large language model training. </p>
<p>The core dispute is whether AI training and answer generation are extensions of traditional indexing and snippet creation, or a distinct use that requires licensing, attribution, or both.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: New web standards could redefine how AI models use your content</p>
<p>With publishers reporting traffic drops of 20–50% on informational queries, the complaint – led by a coalition of European news and specialist publishers – targets three practices:</p>
<p>Regulators are being asked to examine three core questions:</p>
<p>For the SEO community, this probe marks what may be the start of the post-click era, where the battle for visibility shifts from the SERP to the LLM context window. </p>
<p>The open question is whether Google is ready for that shift.</p>
<p>The zero-click search experience is often discussed, but for it to work for all parties, three conditions need to be met:</p>
<p>At present, Google appears eager to move toward a fully zero-click experience, but is not yet able to support it end to end:</p>
<p>In its defense around content repurposing, Google points to opt-out mechanisms such as Google-Extended in robots.txt. </p>
<p>While Google-Extended can block Gemini training, it does not prevent AI-generated answers from fetching live data from publishers’ websites.</p>
<p>In practice, blocking LLM training has several limitations:</p>
<p>Many publishers want to opt out of crawling or having their content used in AI-generated answers. </p>
<p>However, if AI answers become the default interface as search moves further toward a zero-click experience, relying solely on direct or organic traffic may become increasingly risky.</p>
<p>In practice, this creates a lose-lose dynamic. </p>
<p>Blocking usage may protect intellectual property but reduce visibility, while staying open preserves presence at the cost of control. </p>
<p>Without regulatory protections in place, publishers are largely left to play within the system as it exists today.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How AI answers are disrupting publisher revenue and advertising</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Since websites exist, we tend to assume they are ours to control. </p>
<p>But without search engines, their reach is limited. </p>
<p>That tension sits at the heart of a debate that has split SEO opinion.</p>
<p>On one side is the “Google doesn’t owe you anything” camp. </p>
<p>On the other side is the “It’s not their content” perspective. </p>
<p>This debate plays out daily across social media, Reddit threads, and Quora discussions. </p>
<p>Some point to generative engine optimization, or GEO, as a potential survival path, where being quoted in AI answers replaces traditional rankings. </p>
<p>But that approach still leaves publishers dependent on Google’s decisions about linking and on users choosing to click through.</p>
<p>In practice, both sides have valid arguments. </p>
<p>Still, the broader direction appears clear. </p>
<p>Even if Google faces penalties from this investigation, search is unlikely to revert to a blue-links-only model. </p>
<p>The shift toward a zero-click experience is already underway.</p>
<p>Before examining the potential outcomes of the complaint and what they may mean for SEOs, it is worth considering the consequences for information itself.</p>
<p>As creators feel their work is being reused without permission or reward, the incentive to produce original, high-quality content diminishes. </p>
<p>At the same time, the volume of AI-generated content created with minimal human input continues to grow. This trend is not marginal. </p>
<p>Entire websites now exist with thousands of pages produced almost entirely by generative systems.</p>
<p>Much of this material is derived from existing text that has been reworked, combined, or lightly altered, often with occasional hallucinations or inaccuracies. </p>
<p>That content, in turn, feeds new AI answers and additional AI-generated material, creating a cycle of content reuse, error propagation, and declining informational quality due to a lack of genuinely new inputs.</p>
<p>From that perspective, the debate over AI training and content rights is not only about traffic or monetization.</p>
<p>It also raises fundamental questions about how the web sustains original knowledge creation – and why protecting publishers may be necessary to prevent long-term degradation of information quality.</p>
<p>For years, the contract between Google and publishers was simple: “I let you crawl, you give me clicks.” </p>
<p>Generative AI has broken that contract. </p>
<p>If the EU finds Google’s practices anticompetitive, we could see three major shifts in the search landscape:</p>
<p>While this is primarily a story about AI, content rights, and SEO, ads remain the elephant in the SERP.</p>
<p>As more organic real estate is consumed by AI-generated summaries and assistive chat, the last predictable lever for visibility remains paid ads. </p>
<p>Even if the EU forces Google to rein in its AI answers or improve attribution, the total space left for traditional blue links is unlikely to expand significantly. </p>
<p>The available space will continue to favor Google’s revenue-generating products.</p>
<p>If AI Overviews dominate above the fold and organic links are pushed further down, CPCs will likely rise, whether inside or outside AI answers. </p>
<p>Advertisers will compete more aggressively for the remaining clickable positions. </p>
<p>Regardless of how the AI future plays out for Google, the direction is clear: the price of visibility is increasing.</p>
<p>Even before any formal EU decision, leading teams are shifting from “rank for the keyword” to “be the primary entity answer wherever the model looks.” </p>
<p>As legal and technical frameworks evolve, the strategic challenge is to remain machine-readable and rights-aware, asserting control over how content is used while ensuring the brand remains present wherever AI answers are trusted most.</p>
