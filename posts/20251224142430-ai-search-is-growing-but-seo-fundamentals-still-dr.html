<p>Published on December 22, 2025</p>
</div>
<p>Generative AI is everywhere right now. It dominates conference agendas, fills LinkedIn feeds, and is reshaping how many businesses think about organic search. </p>
<p>Brands are racing to optimize for AI Overviews, build vector embeddings, map semantic clusters, and rework content models around LLMs.</p>
<p>What gets far less attention is a basic reality: for most websites, AI platforms still drive a small share of overall traffic. </p>
<p>AI search is growing, no question. </p>
<p>But in most cases, total referral sessions from all LLM platforms combined amount to only about 2% to 3% of the organic traffic Google alone delivers.</p>
<p>Despite that gap, many teams are spending more time chasing AI strategies than fixing simple, high-impact SEO fundamentals that continue to drive measurable results. </p>
<p>Instead of improving what matters most today, they are overinvesting in the future while underperforming in the present.</p>
<p>This article examines how a narrow focus on AI can obscure proven SEO tactics and highlights practical examples and real-world data showing how those fundamentals still move the needle today.</p>
<p>In an era where everyone is obsessed with things like vector embeddings and semantic relationships, it’s easy to forget that small updates can have a big impact. </p>
<p>For example, title tags are still one of the simplest and most effective SEO levers to pull. </p>
<p>And they are often one of the on-page elements that most websites get wrong, either by targeting the wrong keywords, not including variations, or targeting nothing at all.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, a client saw a win by simply adding “&amp; [keyword]” to the existing title tag on their homepage. Nothing else was changed.</p>
<p>Keyword rankings shot up, as did clicks and impressions for queries containing that keyword.</p>
<p>This was all achieved simply by changing the title tag on one page. </p>
<p>Couple that with other tactics, such as on-page copy edits, internal linking, and backlinking across multiple pages, and growth will continue. </p>
<p>It may seem basic, but it still works. </p>
<p>And if you only focus on advanced GEO strategies, you may overlook simple tactics that provide immediate, observable impact. </p>
<p>Another tactic that has faded from view with the rise of AI is what’s often called the skyscraper technique. </p>
<p>It involves identifying a set of keywords and the pages that already rank for them, then publishing a materially stronger version designed to outperform the existing results.</p>
<p>It’s true that the web is saturated with content on similar topics, especially for keywords visible in most research tools. </p>
<p>But when a site has sufficient authority, a clear right to win, and content freshness, this approach can still be highly effective.</p>
<p>I’ve seen this work repeatedly. </p>
<p>Here’s Google Search Console data from a recent article we published for a client on a popular, long-standing topic with many competing pages already ranking. </p>
<p>The post climbed to No. 2 almost immediately and began generating net-new clicks and impressions.</p>
<p>Why did it work? </p>
<p>The site has strong authority, and much of the content ranking ahead of it was outdated and stale.</p>
<p>If you’re hesitant to publish the thousandth article on an established topic, that hesitation is understandable. </p>
<p>This approach won’t work for every site. But ignoring it entirely can mean passing up clear, high-confidence wins like these.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Hype around AI-driven shopping experiences has led some teams to believe traditional website optimization is becoming obsolete. </p>
<p>There is a growing assumption that AI assistants will soon handle most interactions or that users will convert directly within AI platforms without ever reaching a website.</p>
<p>Some of that future is beginning to take shape, particularly for ecommerce brands experimenting with features like Instant Checkout in ChatGPT. </p>
<p>But many websites are not selling products. </p>
<p>And even for those that are, most brands still receive a significant volume of traffic from traditional search and continue to rely on calls to action and on-page signals to drive conversions.</p>
<p>It also makes little difference how a user arrives – via organic search, paid search, AI referrals, or direct visits. </p>
<p>A fast site, a strong user experience, and a clear conversion funnel remain essential.</p>
<p>There are also clear performance gains tied to optimizing these elements. </p>
<p>Here are the results we recently achieved for a client following a simple CTR test:</p>
<p>Brands that continue to invest in user experience and conversion rate optimization will outperform those that do not. </p>
<p>That gap is likely to widen the longer teams wait for AI to fully replace the conversion funnel.</p>
<p>There is no dispute that AI is reshaping the search landscape. </p>
<p>It’s changing user behavior, influencing SERPs, and complicating attribution models. </p>
<p>The bigger risk for many businesses, however, is not underestimating AI but overcorrecting for it.</p>
<p>Traditional organic search remains the primary traffic source for most websites, and SEO fundamentals still deliver when executed well. </p>
<p>These are just a few examples of tactics that remain effective today.</p>
<p>Importantly, these efforts do not operate in isolation. </p>
<p>Improving a website’s fundamentals can strengthen organic visibility while also supporting paid search performance and LLM visibility.</p>
<p>Staying informed about AI developments and planning for what’s ahead is essential. </p>
<p>It should not come at the expense of the strategies that are currently driving measurable growth.</p>
