<p>These trends reflect profound shifts in how consumers behave, how platforms operate, and how marketers integrate strategy and tactics.</p>
As we head into the new year, the age of experimentation is giving way to the age of execution. The past few years have been about “Can we do it?” – generative AI, the decline of cookies, retail <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> networks (RMNs), shoppable video, immersive experiences. Now, the question is: “Are we doing it, and doing it well?”
I’m going to walk through the top 10 digital marketing trends that I believe every forward-looking marketer must own in 2026. These aren’t just buzzwords; they reflect profound shifts in how consumers behave, how platforms operate, and how marketers must integrate strategy across data, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a>, and creativity.
What you’ll see: Conversational search rewriting SEO; video turning fully into commerce; privacy and data ownership as competitive advantage; retail <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> networks moving from niche to mainstream; creators and communities driving co-creation; AI becoming the operating system of marketing; measurement morphing as attribution crumbles; immersive gamification emerging; and above all, the human edge – the talent and culture that will decide who wins.
<p>Let’s dive in, trend by trend.</p>
<p>The evolution of search is accelerating from keyword-based queries to conversational queries, away from clicks to answers inside the engine, and from “search” to “wherever people ask questions.” Platforms such as Google LLC (with AI Overviews), Bing Copilot, and other generative-search interfaces are rewriting what “visibility” means.</p>
<p>Search Everywhere Optimization – influence audiences in all the places they go to consume content about your topic – is no longer optional.</p>
From the stats side: Digital <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a> industry growth is forecast at a ~13.9 % CAGR over the next years.
<p>For SEO practitioners: Shift from creating pages for keyword rankings to creating authoritative answer-centered content, structured with schema, designed for featured snippets, voice devices, and even generative AI-powered answer boxes. Also, anticipate more “zero-click” scenarios where users get answers without visiting your site.</p>
<p>Takeaway: Optimize for intent, structure for conversational and multimodal search, and measure outcomes beyond clicks (e.g., brand lift, FAQ visibility, conversational voice assistant triggers).</p>
Short form, live <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">video</a>, interactive video – the convergence of video and commerce is now in full swing. Social platforms long treated video as engagement; now they’re treating it as transactional.
From recent stats: An IAB study found that 86% of advertisers are already using or plan to use generative AI for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">video</a> ad production, and projected adoption suggests Gen AI-created video ads will represent ~40 % of all video ads by 2026.
<p>In parallel, social commerce revenues continue to climb, for example, via live-shopping, shoppable posts, and in-stream checkout.</p>
For brands: The key is to treat <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">video</a> not just as storytelling but as a direct path to purchase. That means interactive elements, product overlays, live shopping, shoppable end cards, integration with ecommerce platforms. And from a measurement perspective: Tie views to actions (add-to-cart, check-out) rather than just vanity metrics (views, likes).
Takeaway: Convert <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">video</a> from brand engagement to commerce engagement. Build video assets with embedded purchase triggers and assign them full-funnel measurement.
The demise of the third-party cookie, increased regulation, and heightened consumer sensitivity around <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> mean you must look inward: Your first-party data, consent-based profiling, and data architecture become your competitive center.
Recent forecasts by WPP <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> suggest global digital advertising will hit north of US$1 trillion in 2025, with digital representing 73.2% of global ad revenue. And according to EMARKETER’s forecast from May 2025, “BUS advertisers are expected to allocate 66% of their digital budget to mobile in 2025.”
What this means: If you rely solely on third-party <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> or on open-web cookies for targeting and measurement, you’re exposed. You need to build a “data spine” – consent capture, a robust customer data platform (CDP), conversion event APIs (such as from paid platforms), identity resolution, and integrate offline + online signals.
Takeaway: Make first-party data and measurement architecture a foundational pillar of your 2026 strategy. Without it, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> investment and optimization will degrade rapidly.
Once the playground of major ecommerce players, retail <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> networks (RMNs) are now becoming central to brand media planning. Because they combine rich first-party purchase or transaction data with premium placement, they offer one of the few “full-funnel” channels where exposure, consideration, and conversion can be directly tied to real SKU-level outcomes.
According to recent reporting by Business Insider, RMN ad spend is projected to reach roughly $62 billion in 2025, representing about 17.9% of all digital <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> spend – and the expectation is that share will exceed 20% in 2026.
What this means for marketers: You cannot treat RMNs as an afterthought or “just another display buy.” They deserve full-funnel planning, dedicated measurement (e.g., via conversion APIs and offline attribution), and coordination with your broader <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> mix. If you’re still viewing RMNs as tactical or experimental, then you risk lagging behind brands that build internal capabilities now.
Takeaway: Build your RMN strategy today. Integrate product data, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> planning, and measurement, and align with ecommerce/pricing/product teams to maximize return on investment (ROI).
Influencer <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a> has matured. In 2026, the shift is from paying creators to post, to co-creating with creators – product, campaign, community. Creators are becoming strategic partners, not simply reach vehicles.
Academic research confirms that influencer <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a> remains important, yet the landscape is shifting toward deeper partnerships and ownership of creative strategy. Brands will increasingly structure programs where creators ideate product features, create limited-edition lines, or participate in campaign planning. The value: authenticity, niche affinity, and stronger performance than generic sponsorship.
Takeaway: Shift from “influencer as amplifier” to “creator as partner.” Embed creators in product, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a>, and measurement cycles, and treat them as co-owners of the brand experience.
<p>In 2026, audiences don’t just want to buy; they want to belong. And they demand authenticity. That means brand engagement built on community, and authenticity built on internal voices (employees, leadership) and genuine brand purpose.</p>
<p>Reports highlight that consumers increasingly seek interaction, transparency, and ethics in brand communications.</p>
From a <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a> operational standpoint: Companies will invest more in owned channels (forums, apps, micro-communities), user-generated content, peer-to-peer (P2P) mechanisms, and internal advocacy (employee social, leadership content).
<p>Takeaway: Build and nurture community; activate internal voices; make authenticity measurable (engagement, membership retention, referral), not just “brand good feeling.”</p>
We often talk about AI in creative terms – generative text, images, videos. But the true breakthrough in 2026 is AI as the operating system behind marketing: analytics, optimization, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> buying, workflow automation, customer journeys.
According to Reuters, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> powerhouse Meta Platforms aims to fully automate advertising with AI by end of 2026. Brands may soon supply a product image and budget and let the AI build the ad, target it, optimize it.
Gartner also emphasizes that marketing’s future is built around <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> prepared for automated interactions.
For SEO professionals, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">digital</a> marketers, and content writers: The decision is no longer “Should we use AI?” but “How do we govern, integrate and scale AI across planning, creative, measurement and optimization?” It means human-in-the-loop becomes essential – humans set strategy, guard for bias, ensure brand safety – while AI executes at scale.
Takeaway: Treat AI as your marketing OS. Design your workflows, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> architecture, and governance accordingly. Upskill teams accordingly (see Trend 10).
With traditional attribution (last click, multi-touch) collapsing under the weight of privacy, walled gardens, and cross-device fragmentation, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a> mix modeling (MMM) is regaining prominence as the lens through which brands measure business impact.
According to stats on EMARKETER, “by 2026, programmatic methods will account for 90% of all <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">digital</a> display ad spending worldwide,” And given these volumes, brands need robust measurement frameworks that go beyond platform-provided attribution.
Open-source tools such as Meta’s Robyn, or other MMM solutions, are being deployed to link <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> spend to business outcomes – revenue, margin, customer lifetime value. For 2026, you should build or refine your MMM engine and ensure it integrates both online and offline, as well as walled-garden signals.
Takeaway: Invest in MMM infrastructure, align <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> teams with finance/analytics, and report marketing performance in business terms (incremental lift, ROI), not just vanity metrics.
<p>The boundary between entertainment, engagement, and commerce continues to blur. Augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), gamified campaigns, live-interactive formats – all move marketers beyond static ad formats into memory-creating experiences.</p>
A 2025 Digital <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> Trends survey by Deloitte Insights shows that hyperscale social-video platforms are reshaping consumption habits, decidedly moving away from passive to interactive.
<p>For brands: It’s no longer enough to show an image of a product and hope for clicks. Successful immersive programs will incorporate tangible utility (e.g., AR try-ons, live quiz/gamified product launches, metaverse showroom visits) and strong measurement frameworks (engagement → store visits → purchases).</p>
Takeaway: Allocate a portion of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a>/experience budget to immersive, interactive formats; prioritize real utility and tie back to conversion metrics, not just “wow” experiences.
At the heart of all these shifts is your team. Technology moves fast; people and culture move slower. In 2026, the brands that win will be those who invest in training, hybrid talent, decision-making agility, and cross-disciplinary skills (data, creative, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a>).
<p>A McKinsey report found that while 92% of companies plan to boost AI investments in the next three years, only 1% consider themselves fully mature, having AI deeply integrated into their operations and delivering significant business results.</p>
So, your 2026 mandate: Build your internal marketing capability around three pillars: data literacy (understanding analytics, measurement, first-party data), AI fluency (how to use, govern, and scale AI), and cross-channel orchestration (<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a>, product, commerce, owned-community). Without that, your strategy may be robust on paper but fragile in execution.
Takeaway: Make upskilling, talent, and culture as important as technology and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a>. Build a team that can move quickly, learn continuously, and collaborate across functions.
What ties these trends together? Two words: integrated authority. Marketers in 2026 must move beyond channel silos (search vs. social, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">media</a> vs. commerce, data vs. creative) and build integrated systems that deliver unified experiences. At the same time, they must earn authority – through first-party data, community-based trust, creator partnerships, and measurable business impact.
As you plan and execute your 2026 <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a> strategy:
The brands and teams that master this discipline will not only keep pace, but they will also define the next wave of digital <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a>. The question isn’t which of these trends you pick; it’s how deeply you embed them in your organization and operations.
So, here’s to 2026, the year where strategy becomes execution, complexity becomes clarity, and digital <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">marketing</a> becomes truly business-driven.
