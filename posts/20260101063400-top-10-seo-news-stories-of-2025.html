<p>Published on December 29, 2025</p>

<p>Another year in search has come and gone, and Google called it year three of a 10-year platform shift. In 2025, that shift became impossible to ignore. AI moved from experiments and previews into the core of how search actually works. </p>
<p>Below are the biggest SEO news stories of 2025 on Search Engine Land.</p>
<p>Note: This article doesn’t include any stories related to Google algorithm updates. Barry Schwartz wrote a separate recap on that, which will also publish today.</p>
<p>Independent researcher Metehan Yesilyurt analyzed browser-level interactions to reveal how Perplexity scores, reranks, and sometimes drops content. He uncovered a three-layer machine-learning reranker for entity searches, manual authority whitelists, and dozens of engagement and relevance signals. </p>
<p>Yesilyurt’s research also found boosts for authoritative domains, strong early performance, and topics centered on tech and AI. Rankings further reflected time decay, interconnected content clusters, and synchronized YouTube trends that increased visibility across platforms.</p>
<pre><code>    The SEO toolkit you know, plus the AI visibility data you need.
</code></pre>
<p>Google added Query groups to the Search Console Insights report. The feature uses AI to cluster similar search queries into clear audience topics and does not affect rankings. It rolled out gradually to high-volume sites and replaced long query lists with topic-level groupings that make performance shifts easier to spot.</p>
<p>HubSpot’s organic traffic appeared to fall from 13.5 million to 8.6 million in a month, with most of the losses coming from its blog. The drop followed several Google updates, and SEOs publicly pointed to thin, off-topic, traffic-at-all-costs content that drifted beyond HubSpot’s core expertise.</p>
<p>The SEO identity crisis continued as Google dismissed new acronyms like GEO (generative engine optimization) and AEO (answer engine optimization), arguing that good SEO is good GEO, and that the same fundamentals drive AI Overview rankings. </p>
<p>That stance collided with Google’s own admission that search traffic decline is inevitable as AI answers replace clicks, even while traditional search still dominates discovery at a massive scale. </p>
<p>Yet, search behavior is fracturing: users turn to AI for quick answers and to Google for deeper research, pushing brands to optimize for visibility, not just traffic.</p>
<p>Google rapidly expanded AI Mode from an opt-in experiment into a widely available, and possibly soon default, search experience. It added deeper research, agentic actions, personalization, and Gemini 2.5, signaling longer and more complex search behavior. </p>
<p>At the same time, AI Mode exposed major transparency gaps. It initially broke referral tracking and still blends performance data into standard Search Console reports, raising new concerns about visibility, attribution, and what SEO becomes as AI takes on a larger role in search.</p>
<p>Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince said AI was breaking the web’s search-driven business model. He said Google scraped far more content while sending back much less traffic because of zero-click results. He added that AI companies deepen the imbalance by consuming huge amounts of content with little return to creators, putting original publishing at risk unless the economic model changes.</p>
<p>Statcounter data showed Google’s global search share fell below 90% in October, November, and December 2024, the first time its search share remained under 90% since early 2015. The decline was driven mainly by Asia, alongside a December U.S. dip to 87.39%. Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo captured much of the lost share.</p>
<p>Google tightened its stance on AI-generated content by telling quality raters to give the Lowest ratings to pages where most main content is auto- or AI-generated with little originality or added value. It also expanded its spam definitions to target scaled, low-effort AI use. </p>
<p>At the same time, Google tested AI-generated and AI-summarized search snippets, pointing to a future where AI both judges content more harshly and increasingly controls how that content appears in search.</p>
<p>Analyses from Seer, Ahrefs, Amsive, and BrightEdge all showed the same pattern. Google Search produced more impressions and more AI Overview visibility, but sent fewer clicks. The drop was sharpest on non-branded, informational queries, where AI Overviews pushed classic results down, and CTR fell hard. </p>
<p>The studies also found a winner-take-some dynamic. Brands cited in AI Overviews saw higher paid and organic CTR, while those left out lost ground, showing that AI visibility increasingly drives results.</p>
<p>Google’s removal of the long-standing &amp;num=100 search parameter disrupted SEO data across the industry. It broke rank-tracking tools and coincided with sharp drops in Google Search Console impressions and query counts. </p>
<p>Early analysis showed most sites lost reported visibility, especially beyond Page 1. The change suggested years of inflated metrics from scrapers and a new, possibly more accurate, view of organic performance.</p>
<pre><code>    Track, optimize, and win in Google and AI search from one platform.
