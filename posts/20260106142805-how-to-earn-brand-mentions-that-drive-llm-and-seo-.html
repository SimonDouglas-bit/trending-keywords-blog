<p>Remember when link building was all the rage in SEO? </p>
<p>While it never disappeared, its role evolved as Google introduced clearer guidelines and placed greater emphasis on quality, relevance, and intent.</p>
<p>Today, as AI search reshapes the organic landscape, link building has shifted into a closely related – and increasingly prioritized – initiative: brand mentions.</p>
<p>You might think of brand mentions as “citations,” but in the context of AI search, citations describe how brands are referenced by LLMs. </p>
<p>Brand mentions are the input that leads to those citations. To avoid confusion, this article uses brand mentions to describe the tactic itself.</p>
<p>Beyond their role as a leading – if not the leading – factor influencing AI search citations, brand mentions are also gaining weight in traditional SEO algorithms. </p>
<p>To build durable organic visibility for your brand or clients, brand mentions should be a priority in 2026.</p>
<p>Let’s break down what that looks like in practice.</p>

<p>Instead, they evaluate mentions, context, and repeated co-occurrence between your brand and the topics you want to rank for.</p>
<p>Brand mentions are part of the ranking moat. </p>
<p>They compound over time, and they matter even more when competitors are not investing in the same signals.</p>
<p>From a prioritization standpoint, brand mentions should come:</p>

<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>Passive brand mentions occur when something you produce fills a gap in the broader information ecosystem. </p>
<p>The goal is to make your brand the easiest source to reference.</p>
<p>They are earned by creating referenceable assets, not just content. Examples include:</p>

<p>The most effective outreach for earning brand mentions is relationship-driven and anchored in information value.</p>
<p>Key guidelines include:</p>
<p>The long-term objective is to build an outreach engine by developing relationships with writers and personalities who are more likely to reference your brand in future work. </p>
<p>In some cases, there is added value when those relationships extend into content collaboration.</p>
<p>Beyond budget considerations, PR support is most effective for building brand mention momentum when:</p>
<p>If technical SEO fundamentals are still unresolved or reference-worthy assets are not yet in place, PR is premature. </p>
<p>When a brand is ready to function as a source, PR accelerates the signal flywheel.</p>

<p>Many of the long-standing lessons from link building still apply. </p>
<p>Avoid low-quality publications, and do not confuse volume with impact. </p>
