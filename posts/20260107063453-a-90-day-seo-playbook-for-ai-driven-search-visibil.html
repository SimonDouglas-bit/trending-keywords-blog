<p>Published on January 05, 2026</p>

<p>SEO now sits at an uncomfortable intersection at many organizations.</p>
<p>Leadership wants visibility in AI-driven search experiences. Product teams want clarity on which narratives, features, and use cases are being surfaced. Sales still depends on pipeline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traditional rankings, traffic, and conversions continue to matter. What has changed is the surface area of search.</p>
<p>Pages are now summarized, excerpted, and cited in environments where clicks are optional and attribution is selective. </p>
<p>When a generative AI summary appears on the SERP, users click traditional result links only about 8% of the time.</p>
<p>As a result, SEO teams need a clearer playbook for earning visibility inside generative outputs, not just around them.</p>
<p>This 90-day action plan outlines how to achieve this in a phased, weekly execution, with practical adjustments tailored to the specific purpose of the website.</p>
<p>Keywords still matter. But AI systems organize information around entities, topics, and questions, not just query strings.</p>
<pre><code>    The SEO toolkit you know, plus the AI visibility data you need.
</code></pre>
<p>The first step is to decide what you want AI tools to associate your brand with.</p>
<p>Where this shifts by website type</p>
<p>If you can’t clearly articulate what you want AI systems to associate you with, neither can they.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Chunk, cite, clarify, build: A content framework for AI search</p>
<p>Generative engines consistently surface content that is easy to extract, summarize, and reuse. </p>
<p>In practice, that favors pages where answers are clearly framed, front-loaded, and supported by scannable structure.</p>
<p>High-performing pages tend to follow a predictable pattern.</p>
<p>AI-friendly content structures include: </p>
<p>This increases the likelihood your content is:</p>
<p>For ecommerce and services sites in particular, this is often where internal resistance shows up. Teams worry that answering questions too directly will reduce conversion opportunities. </p>
<p>In AI-driven search, the opposite is usually true: pages that make answers easy to extract are more likely to be surfaced, cited, and revisited when users move from research to decision-making.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: Organizing content for AI search: A 3-level framework</p>
<p>In generative search, content that gets surfaced typically resolves the core question immediately, then provides context and depth. </p>
<p>For many commercial teams, that requires rethinking how early pages prioritize explanation versus persuasion – a shift that’s increasingly necessary to earn visibility at all.</p>
<p>This is where GEO (generative engine optimization) and AEO (answer engine optimization) move from theory into page-level execution.</p>
<p>What is generative engine optimization?</p>
<p>Generative engine optimization (GEO) helps content get selected as a source in AI-generated answers.</p>
<p>In practice, GEO is the process of structuring and optimizing content so AI tools like ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews can interpret, evaluate, and reference it when responding to user queries.</p>
<p>How does answer-first structure change by site type?</p>
<p>Structured data remains one of the clearest ways to signal meaning and credibility to AI-driven search systems. </p>
<p>It helps generative engines quickly identify the source, scope, and authority behind a piece of content – especially when deciding what to cite.</p>
<p>At a minimum, most sites should implement:</p>
<p>FAQ schema, where it reflects genuine question-and-answer content, can still reinforce structure and intent – but it should be used selectively, not as a default.</p>
<p>This matters differently by site type:</p>
<p>Structured data doesn’t guarantee inclusion – but in generative search environments, its absence makes exclusion more likely.</p>
<p>Get the newsletter search marketers rely on.</p>
<p>As generative systems decide which sources to reference, demonstrated experience increasingly outweighs polish alone. </p>
<p>Pages that surface consistently tend to show clear evidence that the content comes from real people with real expertise. </p>
<p>Meaning, signals associated with E-E-A-T – experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trust – remain central to how generative systems decide which sources to reference.</p>
<p>Key signals to reinforce:</p>
<p>This is where generic, AI-generated content reliably falls short. </p>
<p>Without visible signals of experience and accountability, AI systems struggle to distinguish authoritative sources from interchangeable ones.</p>
<p>How different site types should demonstrate experience and authority</p>
<p>If your content reads like it could belong to anyone, AI systems will treat it that way.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: User-first E-E-A-T: What actually drives SEO and GEO</p>
<p>Certain page types are more likely to be cited in AI-generated answers because they organize information in ways that are easy to extract, compare, and reference. </p>
<p>These pages are designed to serve as reference material – resolving common questions clearly and completely, rather than advancing a particular perspective.</p>
<p>Formats that consistently perform well include:</p>
<p>Pages with titles such as “AI SEO Statistics (2025)” or “Best AI SEO Tools Compared” are frequently surfaced because they signal completeness, recency, and reference value at a glance.</p>
<pre><code>    Track, optimize, and win in Google and AI search from one platform.
</code></pre>
<p>For commercial sites, citation-worthy pages don’t replace conversion-focused assets. </p>
<p>They support them by capturing early-stage, informational demand – and positioning the brand as a credible source long before a buyer enters the funnel.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: How generative engines define and rank trustworthy content</p>
<p>Generative systems increasingly synthesize signals across text, images, and video when assembling answers. </p>
<p>Content that performs well in AI-driven search is often reinforced across formats, not confined to a single page or medium.</p>
<p>How this supports different site goals</p>
<p>As generative results absorb more of the discovery layer, traditional click-based metrics capture only part of search performance. </p>
<p>AI visibility increasingly shows up in how often – and where – a brand’s content is referenced, summarized, or surfaced without a click.</p>
<p>With 88% of businesses worried about losing organic visibility in the world of AI-driven search, tracking these signals is essential for demonstrating continued influence and reach.</p>
<p>Signals worth monitoring include:</p>
<p>For long sales cycles in particular, these signals act as early indicators of influence. </p>
<p>AI citations and impressions often precede direct engagement, shaping consideration well before a buyer enters the funnel.</p>
<p>Dig deeper: LLM optimization in 2026: Tracking, visibility, and what’s next for AI discovery</p>
<p>These tools support different parts of an SEO-for-AI workflow, from topic research and content structure to schema implementation and visibility tracking.</p>
<p>AI systems tend to favor content that provides definitive answers to questions. </p>
<p>If your content can’t answer a question clearly in 30 seconds, it’s unlikely to be selected for AI-generated answers.</p>
<p>What separates teams succeeding in this environment isn’t experimentation with new tactics, but consistency in execution. </p>
<p>Pages built to be understandable, referenceable, and trustworthy are the ones generative systems return to.</p>
