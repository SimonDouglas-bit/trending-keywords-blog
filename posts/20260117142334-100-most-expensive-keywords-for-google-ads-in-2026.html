<p>Published on January 12, 2026</p>

<p>These are the 100 most expensive keywords on Google Ads, along with their monthly search volume and cost per click (CPC).</p>
<p>The main reason is due to Google’s ads mechanism:</p>
<p>Companies have to outbid each other in order to secure their spot at the top of the search results. If demand for a keyword is high, it means more companies are bidding for it, therefore driving up the cost per click.</p>
<p>Demand for a keyword is high when companies believe it will generate a return on investment (ROI). Typically, you’ll see this when:</p>
<p>I analyzed the top 10,000 most expensive keywords to see which niches they belong to:</p>
<p>Marketing consultant Dan Kennedy once said, “Whoever can spend the most money to acquire a customer wins.”</p>
<p>Your goal is not to avoid paying for expensive keywords, but to bid for keywords that make sense according to your goals and strategy. If a keyword generates a positive ROI for you, then you should continue bidding on that keyword, no matter how expensive it is. (Expensive is relative after all; a $10 cup of coffee is expensive to me, but could be of value to a snob.)</p>

<p>If your competitors are paying for certain keywords, it may indicate that they’re profitable for them—and could be for you too.</p>
<p>Here’s how to find these keywords:</p>
<p>For example, if we analyze asana.com, we can see they’re bidding on 1,367 keywords in the U.S. We can also see the keywords they’re bidding on and how much they’re paying for each keyword (CPC).</p>
<p>If you hover over the magnifying glass, you can even see the ad they’re running for that keyword and the link they’re sending paid traffic to.</p>
