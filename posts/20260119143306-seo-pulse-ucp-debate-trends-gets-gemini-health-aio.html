<p>Google's Universal Commerce Protocol sparks pricing debate, Trends Explore adds Gemini suggestions, and health AI Overviews face scrutiny after Guardian reporting.</p>
<p>Welcome to this week’s Pulse. Google is laying more groundwork for agent-led shopping, Google Trends is getting a Gemini helper inside Explore, and Google appears to have responded to a report we covered last week on AI Overviews health queries.</p>
<p>Here’s what matters for you and your work.</p>
<p>Google introduced the Universal Commerce Protocol as an open standard meant to help AI agents complete shopping tasks across merchants and platforms. The announcement landed around NRF and was framed as agent-based shopping infrastructure, not a consumer feature on its own.</p>
<p>Key facts: This story got attention for two reasons. First, it shows where Google wants AI Mode shopping to go next. Second, it triggered a familiar debate about personalization and pricing after critics connected Google’s “personalized upselling” language to surveillance pricing narratives. Google has pushed back on that framing, saying upselling means showing premium options and that its Direct Offers pilot cannot raise prices.</p>
<p>I’ve been tracking this build-out since Google began expanding AI shopping features across Search and Gemini. The direction is consistent. Google keeps moving more of the purchase journey into its own interfaces, from product research to comparison to now checkout.</p>
<p>The question for ecommerce practitioners is which parts of the journey you still influence with classic SEO, which parts come down to feeds and structured data hygiene, and which parts are product decisions made inside Google’s surfaces. UCP doesn’t answer that question yet, but it clarifies the direction.</p>
<p>The most useful social commentary this week falls into “consumer risk” versus “plumbing and implementation.”</p>
<p>On the critique side, Lindsay Owens, executive director of Groundwork Collaborative, helped set the tone for the surveillance pricing argument around “personalized upselling.” Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, posted along similar lines, treating individualized pricing as the bigger policy risk sitting behind these kinds of systems.</p>
<p>On the implementation side, Mani Fazeli, VP of Product at Shopify, described what Shopify sees as the point of UCP. He said it “models the entire shopping journey, not just payments” and that “merchants keep their business critical checkout customizations.”</p>
<p>Heiko Hotz, Generative AI Global Blackbelt at Google Cloud, framed it more bluntly from an agent-builder perspective. “Agents are great at reasoning, but they are terrible at navigating a visual website.” Eric Seufert, analyst and publisher of Mobile Dev Memo, weighed in from an incentives angle, arguing the endgame is keeping discovery, conversion, and optimization economically connected to paid media.</p>

<p>Google Trends is redesigning the Explore page with a Gemini-powered side panel that suggests related terms and makes comparisons easier.</p>
<p>Key facts: Google says the update can “automatically identify and compare relevant trends,” with the ability to compare up to eight terms and see more “top and rising” queries per term. The update is rolling out now.</p>
<p>Google keeps making Trends more useful for the discovery phase of keyword research.</p>
<p>Trends has always been valuable, but it can be slow when you start with a vague idea and need to find the right comparison terms. The Gemini panel looks designed to reduce that friction. For practitioners who use Trends early in content planning, this could speed up the process of clustering related topics and spotting seasonal patterns.</p>
<p>Yossi Matias, vice president and head of Google Research, emphasized the Gemini side panel, which suggests related terms, supports comparisons of up to eight queries, and expands the “top” and “rising” query views.</p>
<p>In the SEO community, the initial framing is that this reduces friction in the Explore workflow by surfacing comparison terms faster, but there hasn’t been much detailed feedback yet beyond first impressions.</p>

<p>After the Guardian published examples of AI Overviews giving misleading or potentially risky guidance on medical queries, Google stopped showing AI Overviews for some health searches.</p>
<p>Key facts: The Guardian’s reporting included examples involving pancreatic cancer diet advice and “normal range” explanations for liver tests that reviewers said lacked context. In follow-up coverage, multiple outlets reported that Google removed AI Overviews for certain medical searches after the reporting circulated. Google’s response leaned on two themes: Some examples were missing context or based on incomplete screenshots, and it says most AI Overviews are supported by reputable sources.</p>
<p>I wrote about the Guardian investigation earlier this month, and it fits a pattern that keeps resurfacing as AI Overviews expand into sensitive categories. You also have independent data showing medical Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) queries have some of the highest AI Overview exposure rates.</p>
<p>The issue for SEO practitioners is measurement. You can’t easily verify what AI Overviews say about topics you cover, and the summaries can change or disappear between queries. For anyone working in health, finance, or other YMYL categories, the question is whether AI Overviews help or complicate the trust signals you’ve built through traditional content.</p>
<p>Patient Information Forum highlighted the investigation and pointed to a quote from Sophie Randall, Director of PIF, saying AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information “at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health.”</p>
<p>Pancreatic Cancer UK also posted about participating in the investigation and reiterated that one example summary was “incorrect.” Individual commentary from clinicians and researchers shared the Guardian link and framed it as a higher-stakes version of earlier AI Overview failures.</p>

<p>Each story this week shows Google building more layers between the query and the destination.</p>
<p>UCP moves checkout into Google’s surfaces. The Trends update makes discovery more guided inside Google’s tools. And the health reporting shows what happens when AI summaries sit at the top of results for sensitive queries.</p>
<p>For practitioners, the common theme is control. The more Google handles inside its own interfaces, the harder it becomes to measure what you influenced and what happened upstream of your site.</p>
