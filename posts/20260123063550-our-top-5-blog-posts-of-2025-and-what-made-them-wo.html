<p>Published on January 19, 2026</p>

<p>And, naturally, we wanted to remind you of some of our best blogs 😉</p>
<p>Below, we’ve used Ahrefs Web Analytics to find our most-viewed articles published in 2025.</p>
We were inspired by Amanda Natividad’s SparkToro post. Great stuff from Amanda as usual—check it out for more <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> ideas!
In 2025, three of our five most-visited articles were research studies, created using <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> from Ahrefs.
<p>The remaining two included an SEO blog and an article generated almost entirely by AI.</p>
<p>We have filtered out blogs published pre-2025, or those updated in 2025.</p>
<p>Let’s get into it…</p>
AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overview</a>s Reduce Clicks by 34.5% was our most-viewed article overall, driving ~96,000 visits since it was published back in April, according to Ahrefs Web Analytics.
This research tapped into our first-party <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> to tackle the question every SEO has been asking this year: how much traffic are AI Overviews actually stealing?
We analyzed 300,000 keywords and found that when an AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overview</a> appears, the top-ranking page sees 34.5% fewer clicks compared to similar queries without one.
By comparing clickthrough rates before and after Google’s AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overview</a> rollout, we measured the real impact: position #1 for informational keywords dropped from a 0.056 CTR to just 0.031 after AI Overviews appeared.
The <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> confirmed what many of us suspected—AI Overviews are significantly reducing traffic to top-ranking pages, even when those pages still hold the #1 spot.
An Analysis of AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overview</a> Brand Visibility Factors (75K Brands Studied) came in at number two. I wrote this piece of research to confirm, once and for all, whether PR and off-site brand mentions were the most important factor when it came to AI visibility.
It was a theory I kept hearing everywhere at the time, but I (like others, it turns out) wanted to see the cold hard <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>. Together with Ahrefs’ Data Scientist, Xibeijia, I analyzed 75,000 brands to assess how eleven different branded search factors correlated with AI Overview visibility—we’ve since repeated this study for ChatGPT and AI Mode.
Our biggest finding? Branded web mentions do correlate strongly (0.664) with AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">overview</a> presence—more so than any other factor, including backlinks or domain rating.
<p>We also found that if your brand sits in the bottom 50% of web mentions, you’re essentially invisible to AI systems.</p>
AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> Creation: My Process for High-Quality, SEO-Friendly Articles was our third most-viewed blog, racking up ~30K views.
My teammate Despina Gavoyannis created this practical SOP (standard operating procedure) for marketers wanting to integrate AI into their <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> workflows.
This guide walks through her exact process for using AI as a tool—not a replacement—for creating <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> that ranks.
<p>The post covers everything from finding rankable keywords and identifying search intent, to adding original info that AI can’t generate on its own.</p>
<p>Despina’s SOPs have performed especially well via Google Discover traffic…</p>
<p>Google Discover users seem to engage deeply with practical, step-by-step SOPs that help them complete real tasks.</p>
<p>What Is llms.txt, and Should You Care About It?: Ryan wrote this explainer in just a couple of hours using ChatGPT. Now it’s our fourth most-viewed blog of 2025. </p>
The post breaks down llms.txt, a proposed standard designed to help large language models understand and access structured <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> from websites.
<p>While some developers are experimenting with it, no major LLM provider currently supports it as part of their crawler protocol.</p>
<p>Ryan’s take: It’s a solution in search of a problem.</p>
Search engines already crawl and understand <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> using existing infrastructure like robots.txt and sitemap.xml—LLMs use much of the same setup.
In 2025, Ryan built a seven-part AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> process and has since created 6+ wholesale AI blogs, which, together, have driven ~63,000 views to date.
<p>You can watch how he does it on the Ahrefs Podcast below.</p>
It just goes to show that AI generated <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> really can perform well. Use Ryan’s process to tackle trending and emerging topics before your competitors do.
<p>Google Says “Links Matter Less”—We Looked at 1,000,000 SERPs to See if It’s True: Google has been telling SEOs that links are less important than they used to be, and many in the industry have accepted this as fact.</p>
<p>But is it actually true?</p>
Patrick Stox, Ahrefs’ Technical SEO expert, decided to settle the debate with <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>.
<p>He analyzed the top 1 million keywords by search volume, calculating Spearman correlations between SERP rankings and 20 different SEO metrics including domain rating, backlinks, referring domains, and internal links.</p>
<p>And, guess what? Links still matter—a lot.</p>
<p>While the correlation dropped slightly since a similar 2019 study (from 0.27 to 0.21 for total backlinks), links remained one of the strongest ranking signals, especially for high-volume, competitive queries.</p>
The research also showed that links matter even more for informational <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a>, local queries, and branded searches.
So while Google may be hedging on the importance of links publicly, the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> tells a different story.
Similarly to the SparkToro team, most of our top <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> in 2025 was research-based.
In fact, 56% of our most-viewed posts (across every channel) were <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">research</a> blogs.
<p>Our top 5 articles also tended to differ slightly from source to source.Here are our top performers across organic search, AI search, direct, and social media.</p>
<p>13 of the Best SEO Blogs (Beyond the Usual Suspects) - Ahrefs</p>
<p>Here’s what we learned from our top blogs of 2025…</p>
<p>When it comes to AI, the only certainty is uncertainty. What worked in 2025 might not work in 2026. But that’s exactly why we’ll keep sharing what we learn!</p>
