<p>That felt impossible.</p>
<p>For instance, YouTube has been the internet’s default video platform for nearly two decades. It’s frequently dubbed the second-largest search engine.</p>
<p>So I asked Xibeijia, Ahrefs’ superstar data scientist, to pull our data and double-check.</p>
<p>Turns out, ChatGPT’s global search interest overtook YouTube in April 2025, just 29 months after launching.</p>
<p>And it’s not just YouTube. Between September 2024 and April 2025, ChatGPT surpassed TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube in monthly global search volume.</p>
<p>This isn’t a story about one platform beating another. It’s about the speed. ChatGPT matched the search interest of platforms that took years (sometimes over a decade) to build their brand demand. It did it in under two and a half years.</p>
<p>To measure this, we used Ahrefs’ search intelligence data to track global searches containing each platform’s brand name or connected to the brand entity from January 2022 through October 2025.</p>
<p>This includes searches like “chatgpt login,” “youtube tv,” “facebook marketplace”, anything that signals someone actively looking for these platforms.</p>
<p>Search volume isn’t a perfect proxy for platform usage (people use apps without searching), but it reveals intent. When millions consistently search for a brand month after month, that’s a routine or habit signalling recurring interest.</p>
<p>In ChatGPT’s case, it doesn’t look like that demand is going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>Google’s still substantially ahead. But the gap has been narrowing since early 2023.</p>
<p>Google’s aggregate search volume for all global branded searches declined from approximately 1.1 billion monthly searches in early 2022 to around 713 million by August 2025. ChatGPT went from zero to approximately 460 million in the same period.</p>
<p>If current trajectories hold, ChatGPT’s search interest could match Google’s by mid-2028, overtaking it within 2029.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to the speed. Most other major platforms (social networks, video platforms, messaging apps) took years, sometimes decades, to reach this level of sustained global interest.</p>
<p>ChatGPT compressed that timeline dramatically.</p>
<p>Sure, ChatGPT’s growth comes as no surprise to anyone at this point. What matters is that it still hasn’t reached a plateau.</p>
<p>​​But there’s also another reason: search interest doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It’s often a leading indicator of broader market impact.</p>
<p>We’ve found that search visibility correlates with stock performance for about a third of Nasdaq companies. When search interest rises or falls consistently, market valuation often follows. It’s not a perfect predictor, but it’s a signal, one that shows what people are actually paying attention to.</p>
<p>By that logic, ChatGPT’s trajectory goes beyond platform adoption and focuses on where attention (and eventually, capital) is flowing. If search interest is any indication, we’re watching a fundamental reallocation of how people interact with the internet happen in real time.</p>
<p>And if the current trend holds, we’re about three years away from watching it overtake Google in search interest, too.</p>
