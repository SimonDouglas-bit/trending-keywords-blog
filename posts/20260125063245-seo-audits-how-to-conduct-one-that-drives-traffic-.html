&lt;p&gt;At its core, an SEO audit is a step-by-step review of your website’s technical health, content quality, and search visibility. An SEO audit identifies technical, on-page, content, and link issues on a website. It helps SEO teams identify, prioritize, and fix the issues that block traffic, rankings, and, importantly, conversions. Businesses and SEO teams should create audits to identify opportunities that advance business goals and growth.&lt;/p&gt;",

        At its core, an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit is a step-by-step review of your website’s technical health, content quality, and search visibility. An SEO audit identifies technical, on-page, content, and link issues on a website. It helps SEO teams identify, prioritize, and fix the issues that block traffic, rankings, and, importantly, conversions. Businesses and SEO teams should create audits to identify opportunities that advance business goals and growth.
A modern <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> goes beyond identifying issues that further traditional blue-check rankings in Google Search. With AI search reshaping how users discover brands, marketers now need to evaluate entity signals, brand visibility in AI answers, and how well their content performs in generative engines.
In this guide, you’ll learn how to run an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit that’s helpful in today’s search landscape. I’ve included clear steps, examples, and an SEO audit checklist to help SEO professionals at any skill level drive measurable traffic growth.
Table of <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a>s
An <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit is a structured review of your website. SEO specialists conduct audits at regular intervals, such as quarterly or yearly. Sometimes third-party consultants conduct site audits to bring a fresh set of eyes to the project.
The audit identifies the issues preventing your pages from ranking, being crawled, or converting. Then, the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> strategist turns audit findings into a prioritized plan that directly supports traffic growth, lead generation, and pipeline.
Typically, an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> includes:
<p>Technical health</p>
Crawlability, indexability, page speed, Core Web Vitals, structured <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>, and site architecture.
Meta<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a>, headings, internal linking, URL structure, and topic and keyword clusters.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> quality + depth
E-E-A-T signals, topical authority, freshness, duplication, thin pages, and <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> gaps.
<p>Top-performing pages</p>
<p>Pages generating the most traffic or impressions, with opportunities to improve CTR and rankings.</p>
<p>Revenue-generating pages</p>
<p>Product, service, or conversion pages with the highest commercial impact and what’s blocking them from ranking higher.</p>
<p>Highest-conversion pages</p>
<p>Pages that convert well and can be scaled, replicated, or improved further.</p>
<p>CRO recommendations</p>
<p>Layout friction, UX issues, unclear CTAs, messaging clarity, and engagement metrics.</p>
<p>Backlink profile &amp; gaps</p>
<p>Authority, toxic links, and opportunities to earn links your competitors rely on.</p>
<p>Brand and entity signals</p>
How clearly your brand is understood and categorized by <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> engines and AI models.

Conducting an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit can feel overwhelming, even for experienced marketers. At a minimum, an SEO audit checklist includes crawlability, indexability, page speed, on-page SEO, content quality, technical SEO, and backlinks.
A good <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit will surface hundreds of insights, and in-house teams often find themselves swimming in data without knowing where to start. Quick wins help cut through the noise. Spotting these early gives teams momentum and makes the rest of the audit far easier to interpret.
Here are high-impact, low-effort opportunities <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> specialists should look out for as they move through the audit checklist (the step-by-step audit guide is coming next):

An effective <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit follows a straightforward process, from setting intent to translating data into strategic action.
<p>Here’s a simple five-step framework I use with clients to stay focused.</p>
Important: Although I’m calling this an “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit,” it should always include AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) to reflect how people discover brands today.
Defining the purpose of your audit means getting crystal clear on why you’re doing it and what problem(s) you’re trying to solve. Every audit should start with business goals, not just a list of technical checks, and every <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit improves website traffic and conversions. Still, SEO consultants or SEO team members creating the audit should ask what the underlying issue is and focus efforts on the pages, templates, and metrics that matter most.
Note: An audit is a good practice; sometimes its purpose is to enable <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> specialists to step back and view the site with a fresh set of eyes. But as a best practice, each scheduled audit should have a purpose or goal.
Before I pull any data, I clarify what the business wants to solve. If a client tells me they’ve lost traffic, conversions have dropped, or a new product isn’t ranking, I shape my <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> around that problem. This gives me a clear roadmap. I know which pages matter most and which elements or metrics deserve the closest attention. That doesn’t mean I ignore everything else. My rule is simple: Anything I come across goes into the audit document. There’s no need to gatekeep findings because the person running the audit prioritizes them later.
Research and data gathering is the phase in which <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> specialists collect all quantitative signals that show how your site is performing. It’s the foundational layer of any SEO audit.
Pull all the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">data</a> into one place, like a Google Sheet.
Pro tip: Keep this information stored safely, as it also serves as a benchmark for your next <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a>. All being well, the next audit should demonstrate an increase in metrics such as rankings, traffic, and AI visibility.
At this stage, I’m gathering everything — exports from crawlers, GSC, analytics, and backlink tools. This is what I call the “cookie-cutter <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>” phase: The tools do most of the heavy lifting, and anyone can technically do it. I move all the data into sheets, set up conditional formatting, and highlight anything unusual. I’m not trying to solve anything yet; I’m simply collecting and quietly analyzing the raw material.
Human analysis is where the raw data becomes insight. This is the strategic layer of the audit; the part that tools can’t do for you. A sophisticated <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> reads between the lines, connects patterns, and understands why the issues exist and how they impact traffic, rankings, conversions, and AI visibility. It’s where the audit stops being a spreadsheet exercise and starts becoming a roadmap.
What’s critical: Align <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> insights with your business strategy — product priorities, revenue-driving pages, seasonal demand, campaigns, and sales goals. Refer back to the team’s notes and comments from step one.
<p>During this stage, I start forming ideas about where we could take the site. For example, if a brand has told me they’re interested in reaching a specific audience, I quietly spot opportunities to do so and record all insights in a spreadsheet.</p>
Then, even though I have a clear direction from the client in step one, I like to meet again in step four. By then, we can review the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> data and determine whether priorities or goals need to change. Sometimes the data aligns fully with what the client said in phase one; if so, a quick confirmation is helpful before I dive into creating the plan.
This phase is where your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> insights meet the realities of the business. At this stage, SEO specialists can work with stakeholders to ensure the recommendations make sense in the broader context of strategy, priorities, capacity, and upcoming campaigns. This step validates your assumptions, fills in knowledge gaps, and ensures the audit isn’t happening in a vacuum.
Sometimes, reviewing the site through the lens of an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit uncovers new insights that need discussion. For example, identify an untapped audience segment, a high-potential content cluster, or a topic area that wasn’t mentioned in step one but could significantly benefit the business. This is the moment to bring those findings to the table and realign on what truly matters moving forward.
<p>Important: When you get to this stage, you’ve likely got a pretty solid idea of where you want to take your strategy. Get stakeholder buy-in before creating it.</p>
This is one of my favorite phases of the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit checklist. As a consultant, in step one, I’m a passive listener to how the website performs. In this stage, I know what’s going on. I’m excited about the project and have my own insights. This meeting has more energy, and more insights are unlocked. When data supports ideas, it’s encouraging, exciting, and motivating.
This is the moment where your findings become a real strategy. After aligning with stakeholders, refine the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> into a clear, prioritized plan that the business can actually execute.
It’s not enough to list issues. The value of an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> lies in translating insights into structured actions, with owners, timelines, and expected outcomes.
This step turns the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> from a diagnostic into an actionable roadmap.
A well-structured plan makes the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> usable, something the business can act on week by week, rather than a document that gets filed away.
I want my <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a>s to be so actionable that anyone could take the document and run with it, feeling confident to implement it. I assign owners, estimate effort, and rank recommendations by impact so the team knows exactly where to start. This is the step where the audit stops being a list of interesting insights and becomes a clear, focused execution plan that actually drives results. If I’m working with the business long term on implementation, I take the audit and manage the actions in a project management tool like Asana.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> specialists should prioritize audit findings by impact, effort, and owner. Interpreting the SEO audit is where the real impact happens. Once the SEO team has collected its findings, the next step is turning them into a clear, prioritized plan that the business can act on. Here’s how to evaluate what matters most and where to start.
Here are some ways to interpret the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> report, in the order I’d prioritize:
Anything preventing <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> engines from crawling or indexing key pages should rise to the top of the priority list. These issues, such as accidental noindex tags, broken internal links, or faulty robots.txt rules, can instantly suppress visibility.
<p>Fixing them often delivers the fastest and most noticeable traffic lift.</p>
These five categories (crawlability, indexability, accessibility, rankability, and clickability) and how they stack within the technical <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> hierarchy are best shown in this graphic, which echoes Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs but reimagined for search engine optimization.
Some findings need immediate attention, not for <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> reasons, but for revenue or reputation reasons. Security vulnerabilities, broken checkout flows, incorrect pricing pages, or inaccessible and broken forms should be treated as non-negotiable priorities. These directly affect conversions and trust.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> specialists should prioritize the content clusters and pages that support the company’s specific goals, whether that is targeting a new audience, promoting a key product, or expanding into a new region.
An <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit should always reflect the business’s direction.
<p>Pro tip: Ask stakeholders for SMART goals, so they’re specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. The graphic below shows what SMART goals look like.</p>
Prioritize content that does more than rank. Pages that support <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>, email nurturing, sales enablement, or product education create compounding value. One high-quality asset can close gaps across multiple touchpoints, especially when tied to a defined content cluster or campaign. HubSpot’s free AI content writer can help with this step.
<p>Look for actions that take less than 30 minutes and deliver measurable improvements.</p>
<p>Updating a title tag or adding a favicon can make a big difference. Sometimes, it’s all that’s needed to move the needle, and if that’s the case, just get it done.</p>
<p>Adding a few internal links, compressing images, or deleting an irrelevant, outdated page can get actionable work moving and build momentum early in the process.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Celebrate the little wins, especially if other departments, like developers, are working on the project. A bit of positivity is motivating, and these small fiddly tasks are surprisingly impactful. The goal? Get the team motivated to complete the work.</p>
Group related issues so teams can work efficiently. A “page speed sprint,” “schema sprint,” or “<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> refresh sprint” helps teams stay focused and reduces context switching.
<p>This makes implementation smoother and helps deliver improvements faster.</p>
<p>Plus, you can report on that particular sprint as soon as it’s done and show everyone the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>Developer resources are usually limited, so use them wisely. Prioritize fixes that affect the entire site: template-level speed issues, schema improvements, navigation changes, or structural improvements. These updates can influence hundreds or thousands of URLs at once.</p>
Pro tip: Want to upscale your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> skills? HubSpot Academy’s SEO Course will help teams learn the skills needed to do SEO work that drives results.
The right tools make your <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> faster, more accurate, and far easier to prioritize. Below are the tools I use most often.

AI search grader assesses brand and entity visibility in AI search results. It evaluates how well your brand appears in AI search results, including generative engines, answer boxes, and conversational interfaces.

The AEO Grader does. It evaluates entity strength, content signals, structured data, and authority markers, all of which heavily influence whether your brand appears in AI-generated responses.
Best for: HubSpot’s AEO Grader is best for marketers ready to move beyond classic rankings and understand how AI <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">search</a> systems perceive their site.
<p>Read more about AEO in this comprehensive guide.</p>

Marketers can use free tools like Website Grader to start an SEO audit; it aligns perfectly with the “quick wins” section of this article. The tool surfaces issues around speed, metadata, and basic technical hygiene that can be fixed early in the audit process.
What it is: HubSpot Website Grader is a free tool that evaluates your website’s <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a>, performance, mobile usability, and security.

<p>Useful resources:</p>
Most <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audits take between two and eight weeks, depending on the size and complexity of the site, and the depth of coverage. For example, smaller sites can be completed in a few days, while enterprise sites with thousands of URLs, multiple templates, and complex technical structures take longer.
The analysis and stakeholder alignment phases often require the most time and are the most important. While a large portion of the <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> involves data gathering and is fairly subjective, there are areas (such as content ideation) that require creativity. In my experience, creativity needs time to develop. Rush your audit, and risk missing out on creative ideas.
<a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> specialists shouldn’t rely on developers to run the audit, but developers are often needed to implement parts of it. SEOs can diagnose and document technical issues, but fixes such as template-level changes, Core Web Vitals improvements, structured data implementation, and JavaScript cleanup typically require development support. The audit itself identifies the work; the developer helps execute it.
Most businesses benefit from a quarterly, biannual, or annual audit. Regular <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audits help maintain and grow search performance over time.
Fast-moving companies, sites with frequent content updates, or businesses heavily impacted by AI search changes may benefit from more frequent checks. At a minimum, run a full <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> once per year to benchmark performance and flag unexpected declines.
You can run a basic <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> using free tools, including:
These tools cover core areas: crawlability, indexability, <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">content</a> quality, and AI search visibility.
An <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit focuses on the elements that influence rankings, visibility, and conversions — technical health, content quality, backlinks, and AI visibility.
A website <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a> is broader. It may include UX design, accessibility, CRO, branding, navigation, and overall site performance.
You can think of an <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit as one part of a full website audit. Both can be combined, but the SEO audit is more specialized and directly tied to traffic growth and search performance.
A well-executed <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> audit doesn’t just surface problems; it turns your website into a growth engine. By reviewing your technical health, content quality, authority signals, and AI search visibility, you can uncover quick wins, shape long-term strategy, and build a roadmap that directly supports traffic, conversions, and pipeline.
Remember: Modern audits go beyond blue links; they evaluate how well your brand shows up in generative search and whether your content is truly understood as an entity. If you want a fast, accurate snapshot of where you stand, tools like HubSpot Website Grader and HubSpot AEO Grader make it easy to assess both <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">seo</a> fundamentals and AI visibility in minutes.
From my experience, the most impactful <a class="internal-link" href="../posts/20250306115058-the-us-stops-sharing-air-quality-data-from-embassi.html">audit</a>s are the ones rooted in business goals and executed collaboratively. I love the point in the process when the data clearly aligns with what stakeholders feel intuitively — or reveals something completely unexpected. When an audit is done well, teams walk away feeling focused, confident, and energized because the path forward is so clear. That’s the sign of a great audit: One that doesn’t just diagnose, but inspires action and drives real results.
