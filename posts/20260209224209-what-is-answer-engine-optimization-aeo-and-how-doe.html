<p>If you‘re familiar with the world of SEO, I probably don’t have to tell you there's been a serious shift in its landscape. Marketers are no longer just optimizing content for Google‘s traditional blue links; we’re now optimizing for AI.</p>
<p>The shift is called Answer Engine Optimization, or AEO. Some practitioners also refer to it as AI engine optimization, and both terms are used interchangeably. But what does it mean to optimize your content for AI engines? I'll explain.</p>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<p>AEO is the practice of optimizing your content so that AI systems cite you as a source and feature your information in direct answers. AEO helps content show up in ChatGPT responses, Google's AI Overviews, voice assistant answers, and essentially anywhere an AI is serving information instead of just links.</p>
<p>But AEO isn't here to replace your SEO program. In fact, think of them as business partners.</p>
<p>Traditional SEO focuses on achieving high rankings in search engine results. AEO focuses on being the answer that AI systems pull from and cite. The goal shifts from “get people to click to your site” to “become the authoritative source AI systems trust and reference.”</p>
<p>So, where does AEO actually appear? Pretty much anywhere AI is answering questions:</p>
<p>You‘ll find that a lot of what makes good SEO also makes good AEO, such as clear, well-structured content that answers real questions. The difference is that to use AEO, you’ll also have to think about how AI systems consume, understand, and cite information, meaning some new considerations come into play.</p>
<p>If AEO isn't replacing SEO, what does it actually add to your workflow? Let me break down the practical differences.</p>
<p>With traditional SEO, you optimize for keywords. With AEO, you're also optimizing for entities, such as the people, places, things, and concepts that AI systems need to understand.</p>
<p>This means being crystal clear about who you are, what you do, and how you connect to other entities in your space. If you're a SaaS company, AI needs to know you exist and how you relate to your industry, competitors, and the problems you solve.</p>
<p>The clearer you are, the more confidently AI can cite you.</p>
<p>AI systems prefer content that directly answers questions, as that's their primary purpose.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean every blog post needs to be an FAQ (please, no), but it does mean structuring content around the questions your audience is actually asking. You want fewer posts like “10 Tips for Better Email Marketing” and more posts like “How Do I Improve My Email Open Rates?” with a clear, concise answer up front.</p>
<p>Schema helps AI systems understand the structure and meaning of your content. Things like FAQ schema, How-To schema, and Article schema provide AI with clear signals about the information you‘re providing and how it’s organized.</p>
<p>With SEO, you‘re thinking about search volume and keyword difficulty. With AEO, you’re also considering model coverage. You may wonder if you are appearing when someone asks ChatGPT or Claude about your topic. Are you cited in AI Overviews?</p>
<p>AEO requires a slightly different content strategy where you're not just targeting high-volume keywords, but also the kinds of questions people ask conversationally to AI systems. These questions are often longer, more specific, and more natural-sounding than traditional search queries.</p>
<p>AI gives users the answer directly, which means they may never visit your site.</p>
<p>Is that frustrating? Sure. But it‘s also reality. The upside? When AI cites you, you’re building brand authority and trust. People start to recognize your name as a credible source, even if they didn't click through this time. Think of it as the long game.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for your content team on a day-to-day basis? The good news is that you don‘t have to overhaul your entire operation. AEO layers onto what you’re already doing, but it does require some intentional shifts.</p>
<p>Before you dive into AEO tactics, make sure your foundational SEO structure is solid. Build out your topic clusters, establish your pillar content, and create a clear content architecture. AI systems crawl and understand content the same way search engines do. So, if your site structure is a mess, AEO won't save you.</p>
<p>Get your house in order first. Then optimize for AI.</p>
<p>Once your clusters are built, map out the questions your audience asks at each stage of their journey. Not just “what keywords should we rank for,” but “what would someone type into ChatGPT about this topic?”</p>
<p>This is where you start creating content specifically designed to be cited, in the form of clear, direct answers, credible sources, and well-structured information—the stuff AI systems love to pull from.</p>
<p>After your content and questions are in place, tackle schema markup and entity optimization. This is the technical layer that helps AI systems understand and cite your content more effectively.</p>
<p>Mark up your FAQs. Add How-To schema to your tutorials. Use the Article schema on your blog posts. Make it as easy as possible for AI to parse and reference your information.</p>
<p>If you‘re juggling ongoing SEO, content production, and now AEO on top of it all, here’s a simple prioritization framework:</p>
<p>Think of it like building a house. You wouldn‘t install smart home tech before you’ve framed the walls. The same logic applies here. Build your foundation first, then the AI-friendly upgrades.</p>
<p>And look, I get it. Adding AEO to your already packed content calendar can feel overwhelming. However, the reality is that if AI systems are answering questions in your space and you're not being cited, you're missing out on visibility and authority. Better to start small and layer it in than to ignore it completely.</p>
<p>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) may sound like another term for AEO, but there are key differences.</p>
<p>GEO specifically refers to optimizing for generative AI systems. Think ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other large language models that generate responses based on prompts. GEO is all about getting these AI systems to cite your content when they're creating answers from scratch.</p>
<p>AEO is the broader umbrella term. It covers optimization for any AI-powered system that surfaces answers, including generative AI, as well as AI Overviews in search, voice assistants, and other AI-augmented platforms.</p>
<p>In other words, GEO is a subset of AEO. All GEO is AEO, but not all AEO is GEO.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: If someone asks ChatGPT for marketing advice and it cites your blog post, that‘s GEO in action. If someone asks Google a question and your content shows up in an AI Overview, that’s AEO (but not necessarily GEO, since it's search-adjacent).</p>
<p>If Alexa reads your recipe instructions out loud, that's also AEO.</p>
<p>They all share the same core goal: getting AI systems to pull from and cite your content as a trusted source.</p>
<p>Honestly? For most content teams, the distinction between AEO and GEO is more academic than practical.</p>
<p>Yes, there are researchers publishing papers specifically on “generative engine optimization” and studying how to rank in LLM outputs. And yes, some practitioners use GEO when discussing ChatGPT or Claude specifically.</p>
<p>But here‘s the thing: the tactics that make you cite-able in one AI system generally make you cite-able in others. You’re not going to optimize differently for ChatGPT versus Google's AI Overviews versus Alexa. The underlying principles are the same.</p>
<p>So, while I‘ll use "AEO" as the catch-all term throughout this post, please note that when we’re discussing showing up in ChatGPT or other generative models, that's the GEO piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Here‘s the best part: you don’t need separate strategies for AEO and GEO. The same content architecture that helps you show up in AI Overviews also helps you get cited by ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Whether it‘s a generative AI model or Google’s AI Overview pulling your content, both love clearly structured question-and-answer formats.</p>
<p>When you write a section that starts with “What is email marketing?” and follows with a direct, concise answer, you‘re making it easy for any AI system to extract and cite that information. The AI doesn’t care whether it's serving that answer in a chat interface or a search result. AI just needs the information to be clear and well-structured.</p>
<p>FAQ schema, How-To schema, and Article schema are all structured data formats that help AI systems better understand your content.</p>
<p>Google‘s AI uses schema to parse your content for AI Overviews. Generative models trained on web data can better understand and reference marked-up content properly. Voice assistants rely on schema to pull accurate information. It’s the same markup, serving multiple AI applications.</p>
<p>You implement it once, and it works across the board.</p>
<p>When you clearly establish who you are, what you do, and how you connect to other entities in your space, every AI system benefits.</p>
<p>Generative models need entity clarity to confidently cite you. Search engines need it to include you in AI Overviews. Voice assistants need it to provide accurate answers. The work you do to strengthen your entity signals — clean NAP data, consistent branding, clear about pages, authoritative backlinks — pays dividends across every AI platform.</p>
<p>Don‘t overthink the AEO vs. GEO distinction. Build content that’s clear, well-structured, and easy for AI to understand, and you'll show up across the entire ecosystem of AI-powered answer engines.</p>
<p>One solid content architecture. Multiple AI systems. Maximum coverage.</p>
<p>That's the sweet spot.</p>
<p>Okay, so you're sold on AEO. Now comes the practical question: which AI systems should you actually be optimizing for?</p>
<p>The good news? You don't need to pick just one. The better news? A lot of the optimization work overlaps. But it does help to understand what each major answer engine tends to favor so you can prioritize your efforts.</p>
<p>Let‘s break down the big players and what they’re looking for.</p>
<p>What It Is: Those AI-generated summaries that appear at the top of Google search results, powered by Google's Gemini model.</p>
<p>What It Favors: AI Overviews tend to pull from pages that already rank well organically, which are typically in the top 20 results. Google prioritizes authoritative, well-structured content with clear answers. If you‘re not showing up in traditional search, you’re likely not appearing in AI Overviews either.</p>
<p>Quick Checklist:</p>
<p>What It Is: Microsoft's AI assistant built into Bing, Edge, and Windows, powered by GPT-4.</p>
<p>What It Favors: Copilot tends to handle navigational and transactional queries well. It pulls from Bing's search index and favors content that clearly states what a product or service does, includes pricing or comparison information, and has strong brand signals.</p>
<p>Quick Checklist:</p>
<p>What It Is: ChatGPT's newer search functionality that browses the web in real-time and cites sources in conversational responses.</p>
<p>What It Favors: ChatGPT Search looks for credible, authoritative sources with clear entity signals. It tends to cite content that directly answers questions, comes from recognizable brands or domains, and includes proper attribution (citing other sources strengthens your own credibility).</p>
<p>Quick Checklist:</p>
<p>What It Is: An AI-powered search engine that provides synthesized answers with inline citations, kind of like a research assistant.</p>
<p>What It Favors: Perplexity loves well-researched, comprehensive content that brings together multiple perspectives. It frequently cites academic sources, data-driven content, and articles that themselves include citations and sources. If your content looks like it was written by someone who did their homework, Perplexity is more likely to cite it.</p>
<p>Quick Checklist:</p>
<p>You probably don‘t have the bandwidth to create completely different content strategies for each answer engine. And honestly, you don’t need to.</p>
<p>The overlap is significant. Clear, well-structured, authoritative content that answers real questions? That works everywhere. Strong entity signals? Helpful across the board. Schema markup? Universal.</p>
<p>So start with the fundamentals that benefit all engines, then layer in specific optimizations based on where your audience is actually looking for answers. If you‘re a B2B SaaS company, maybe you prioritize ChatGPT and Bing Copilot. If you’re in health and wellness, Google AI Overviews and Perplexity might be your focus.</p>
<p>Meet your audience where they are, and optimize accordingly.</p>
<p>Alright, enough theory. Let's talk about how to actually do this inside your content team.</p>
<p>Adding AEO to your workflow takes some upfront effort, but the good news is you don't need to overhaul everything overnight. You can start small, test what works, and scale from there.</p>
<p>Here‘s a step-by-step plan you can actually run with your team, from discovery to publishing to measuring what’s working.</p>
<p>Before you create new content, figure out where you currently stand with AI systems.</p>
<p>Start by testing queries related to your business in different answer engines. Ask ChatGPT questions your customers would ask. Search relevant topics in Google and see if AI Overviews appear. Try the same queries in Perplexity and Bing Copilot.</p>
<p>Are you being cited? Are competitors showing up instead? Are AI systems pulling from outdated or inaccurate sources?</p>
<p>This audit gives you a baseline and helps you identify quick wins, like topics where you have great content but aren‘t getting cited, or gaps where AI is answering questions and you’re nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Now that you know what AI systems are answering, it's time to map those questions back to your existing content strategy.</p>
<p>Look at your topic clusters and pillar pages. For each cluster, brainstorm the questions someone might ask an AI system at different stages (awareness, consideration, decision) of their journey.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a content cluster around email marketing, your questions might include:</p>
<p>The goal here is to create a question map that aligns with your existing content architecture. Instead of starting from scratch, you're identifying which questions your current content answers (or should answer).</p>
<p>This is where the rubber meets the road. You're either creating new content designed to be cited or optimizing existing content to be more cite-able.</p>
<p>When you're writing or updating content with AEO in mind, focus on:</p>
<p>Clear, Direct Answers Up Front Don't bury the lede. If someone asks “What is AEO?” your content should answer that question in the first paragraph, not three scrolls down. AI systems pull from content that gets to the point quickly.</p>
<p>Structured, Scannable Formatting Use headers, bullet points, and short paragraphs. Break complex information into digestible chunks. AI systems extract information more easily from well-organized content.</p>
<p>Question-as-Header Format Consider using the actual question as your H2 or H3 header, followed by a concise answer. For example:</p>
<p>“How Do I Measure Email Marketing ROI?” “To measure email marketing ROI, divide your net profit by your total email marketing costs and multiply by 100...”</p>
<p>This format makes it incredibly easy for AI to identify and extract the relevant answer.</p>
<p>Include Context and Credibility SignalsDon't just state facts, back them up. Include data, cite sources, and reference studies. This builds trust with AI systems and makes your content more cite-worthy.</p>
<p>Once your content is written (or rewritten), it's time to add the technical layer that helps AI understand it.</p>
<p>Implement Schema Markup Add FAQ schema for question-and-answer sections. Use How-To schema for tutorials and step-by-step guides. Apply Article schema to blog posts. This structured data gives AI systems clear signals about what information you're providing.</p>
<p>If you‘re on WordPress, plugins like Yoast or Rank Math make this pretty straightforward. If you’re on HubSpot or another CMS, check if there's built-in schema support or work with your dev team to implement it.</p>
<p>Strengthen Entity Signals Make sure your brand entity is crystal clear across your site:</p>
<p>Think of entity signals as your credibility score with AI systems. The clearer and more consistent your signals, the more confidently AI can cite you.</p>
<p>You've created great content and added the technical polish. Now you need to make sure AI systems actually find it.</p>
<p>Get It Indexed Submit your new or updated pages to Google Search Console. This speeds up the crawling and indexing process so AI Overviews can start pulling from your content sooner.</p>
<p>Promote It Share your content on social media, in newsletters, and anywhere your audience hangs out. The more signals of engagement and authority your content has, the more likely AI systems are to trust and cite it.</p>
<p>Build LinksQuality backlinks still matter. They signal to AI systems that your content is credible and authoritative. Reach out to industry publications, guest post on relevant sites, and look for natural link-building opportunities.</p>
<p>Here‘s where things get tricky. Measuring AEO success isn’t as straightforward as tracking keyword rankings, but there are ways to gauge whether your efforts are paying off.</p>
<p>Manual Testing The most direct method: regularly test your target questions in different answer engines and see if you‘re being cited. Create a spreadsheet with your priority questions and check monthly (or weekly, if you’re ambitious) to track changes.</p>
<p>It‘s manual, it’s time-consuming, but it's also the most accurate way to see if AI systems are pulling from your content.</p>
<p>Monitor Branded and Direct Traffic If AI systems are citing your brand without linking directly to your site (hello, zero-click reality), you might see an uptick in branded searches or direct traffic. People see your name in an AI response, remember it, and come find you later.</p>
<p>Track branded search volume in Google Search Console and watch for changes in direct traffic patterns.</p>
<p>Track Engagement Metrics Look at engagement on the content you've optimized for AEO. Are people staying longer? Reading more pages? Downloading resources? Even if AI gives them the quick answer, the users who do click through are often more engaged because they're already informed and interested.</p>
<p>Use AEO-Specific Tools (If You Have a Budget)There are emerging tools explicitly designed to track AEO performance, such as citation tracking in LLMs or AI visibility scores. These tools are still in development, but if you have the budget and are serious about AEO, they're worth considering.</p>
<p>AEO isn‘t a one-and-done project. It’s an ongoing optimization strategy that evolves as AI systems change and your content library grows.</p>
<p>Start with a small pilot of 5-10 high-priority questions. Test the process, see what works, and learn what doesn‘t. Once you’ve validated the approach, scale it across more topics and content clusters.</p>
<p>And remember: AI systems are constantly evolving. What works today might shift tomorrow. Stay curious, keep testing, and adapt your strategy as the landscape changes.</p>
<p>Building an AEO plan takes time, but if you approach it systematically, you'll begin to see results.</p>
<p>I won‘t lie to you, AEO measurement isn’t as clean as tracking keyword rankings or click-through rates. There's no universal “AEO dashboard” you can pull up that shows you exactly where you rank in ChatGPT.</p>
<p>But that doesn‘t mean you can’t measure success. You just need to get a little creative and look at a combination of signals that, together, tell the story of your AEO impact.</p>
<p>Let me walk you through the metrics that actually matter and how to track them without losing your mind.</p>
<p>What It Is: How often AI systems cite or reference your content when answering relevant questions.</p>
<p>How to Track It: This one requires manual work, unfortunately. Create a list of your priority questions (the ones you've optimized content for) and test them monthly across your target answer engines — Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Bing Copilot.</p>
<p>Document whether your content is cited, how it's cited (direct quote, paraphrased summary, link), and where it appears in the response (primary source, supporting source, or buried in the footnotes).</p>
<p>Yes, it‘s tedious. But it’s also the most direct way to measure whether your AEO efforts are working.</p>
<p>What Good Looks Like: You're seeing an increase in citations month-over-month, especially in your priority answer engines. Bonus points if you move from “not cited at all” to “secondary source” to “primary citation” over time.</p>
<p>What It Is: How often you're cited compared to competitors when AI systems answer questions in your space.</p>
<p>How to Track It: Take that same list of priority questions and note which sources AI systems are citing, like you, your competitors, industry publications, whoever. Calculate your share of voice by dividing the number of times you're cited by the total number of citations across all sources.</p>
<p>For example, if ChatGPT answers 10 questions about email marketing and cites you 4 times, a competitor 3 times, and other sources 3 times, your share of voice is 40%.</p>
<p>What Good Looks Like: Your share of voice is increasing over time, and you‘re being cited as often (or more often) than key competitors. If you’re in a crowded space, even 20-30% share of voice is a win.</p>
<p>What It Is: The number of people searching for your brand name specifically, which can indicate increased awareness from AI citations.</p>
<p>How to Track It: Use Google Search Console to monitor branded search queries. Look for upward trends that correlate with your AEO efforts, especially if you‘re being cited in AI systems that don’t always link back to your site.</p>
<p>When someone sees your name in a ChatGPT response or Perplexity citation, they might not click through immediately. But later, when they need a solution, they remember your brand and search for you directly.</p>
<p>What Good Looks Like: Branded search volume increases over time, particularly after you start getting consistent citations in AI responses. Watch for spikes that align with specific AEO wins (like landing a primary citation in a high-traffic AI Overview).</p>
<p>What It Is: Visitors who come to your site by typing your URL directly or through bookmarks, often driven by brand recognition from AI citations.</p>
<p>How to Track It: Monitor direct traffic in Google Analytics (or whatever analytics platform you use). Look for sustained growth or unusual spikes that can't be explained by campaigns or other marketing efforts.</p>
<p>If AI systems are mentioning your brand but not always linking to you, direct traffic is one of the ways people find you afterward.</p>
<p>What Good Looks Like: Direct traffic grows steadily as your AEO presence increases. You might also see a shift in the quality of direct traffic, such as users who arrive directly from brand recognition tend to be more engaged and further along in their buyer journey.</p>
<p>What It Is: Metrics that indicate people are engaging with your brand even when they don't click through from an AI response, such as time on site, pages per session, and conversion rates from branded or direct traffic.</p>
<p>How to Track It: In your analytics platform, segment users who arrive via branded search or direct traffic and compare their engagement metrics to other traffic sources. Are they spending more time on site? Viewing more pages? Converting at higher rates?</p>
<p>These signals suggest that AI citations are pre-qualifying your audience. By the time they reach your site, they already know who you are and what you offer.</p>
<p>What Good Looks Like: Users from branded/direct sources show higher engagement and conversion rates compared to cold traffic. This indicates that AI citations are building awareness and trust before users even visit your site.</p>
<p>What It Is: Your increasing presence and authority on specific topics, measured by how comprehensively AI systems cite you across related questions.</p>
<p>How to Track It: Map out a topic cluster (say, “email marketing”) and track citations across all related questions within that cluster. Are you being cited for beginner questions? Advanced questions? Tactical how-tos? Strategic overviews?</p>
<p>The more comprehensively you're cited within a topic area, the stronger your topic authority.</p>
<p>What Good Looks Like: You‘re being cited across multiple question types within your core topics, not just one or two. This signals to AI systems (and users) that you’re a comprehensive, authoritative source on the subject.</p>
<p>What It Is: Direct clicks from answer engines that do provide links, such as Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, or Google AI Overviews.</p>
<p>How to Track It: Check your analytics referral traffic for sources like perplexity.ai, chatgpt.com, or Google's AI Overview traffic (which typically shows up as Google organic but can sometimes be identified through UTM parameters or landing page analysis).</p>
<p>Not all AI systems link back, but the ones that do can drive highly qualified traffic.</p>
<p>What Good Looks Like: You're seeing consistent (even if small) referral traffic from AI systems, and those visitors engage well with your content. As AI search adoption grows, this metric will become increasingly important.</p>
<p>Plan for 3-6 months to see meaningful results from AEO efforts. AI systems need time to crawl, index, and begin citing your optimized content, and you‘re also building authority signals that don’t happen overnight.</p>
<p>That said, you might see early wins within 4-6 weeks for low-competition questions or if you're optimizing content that already ranks well organically.</p>
<p>FAQ schema, How-To schema, and Article schema are your heavy hitters for AEO. FAQ schema is particularly effective because it directly maps questions to answers in a format AI systems love to extract.</p>
<p>The How-To schema works well for process-driven content, and the Article schema helps AI understand the structure and context of your long-form content.</p>
<p>The most reliable method is manual testing. Create a spreadsheet with your priority questions and check them monthly across Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Bing Copilot, logging when and how you're cited.</p>
<p>For scaled tracking, some emerging tools like BrightEdge and SEOclarity are adding AEO monitoring features, though the space is still maturing. You can also monitor indirect signals like branded search volume and direct traffic growth that indicate increased AI-driven awareness.</p>
<p>No, AEO complements SEO rather than replacing it. Many AI systems (especially Google AI Overviews) pull from content that already ranks well organically, so strong SEO fundamentals are actually a prerequisite for AEO success.</p>
<p>Think of AEO as an evolution of SEO that optimizes for how AI systems consume and cite information, not a completely separate strategy.</p>
<p>Lead with the risk of inaction. Show leadership examples of competitors or industry leaders being cited in AI responses. At the same time, if your brand is absent, tie it to business metrics they care about, such as branded search growth and market authority.</p>
<p>Frame AEO as a natural extension of existing SEO and content efforts rather than a net-new initiative, and start with a small pilot program (5-10 priority questions) to demonstrate ROI before asking for significant resources.</p>
<p>Most importantly, emphasize that early movers in AEO are establishing authority that will be harder for latecomers to displace as AI adoption accelerates.</p>
