<p>Rankings and traffic aren’t enough anymore, yet replacing them feels risky. A practical look at how SEO KPIs need to evolve.</p>
<p>Most SEO teams believe they need more data to report success, but what they actually have is metric debt, at least that’s what I keep seeing. The accumulated cost of optimizing for key performance indicators that no longer reflect how growth happens.</p>
<p>The environment has changed, mostly because economic pressure has shifted expectations. At the same time, AI search, zero-click results, and privacy limits have all weakened the connection between traditional SEO KPIs and business outcomes.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s not unusual to see teams measuring success in ways that reflect how SEO used to work rather than how it works today. This is exactly the point where I think we need to rethink how we’re measuring things.</p>
<p>Rankings, clicks, visibility … None of these is wrong. They’re just no longer enough on their own to predict business success reliably.</p>
<p>In an environment where we talk a lot about AI-driven SERPs, zero-click searches, and budget scrutiny, these metrics are incomplete at best and misleading at worst.</p>
<p>But a considerable number of SEOs still spend most of their time chasing more traffic, more keywords, more mentions, and I get why. It is generally difficult to own new changes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conversion quality, intent alignment, and revenue impact now need more attention than ever. However, they’re harder to explain and harder to own.</p>
<p>That gap creates a quiet opportunity cost. Not immediately, and not in reports, but later, when SEO starts struggling to justify its place in the growth conversation.</p>
<p>At this point, I think this is pretty clear: good SEO teams don’t report more metrics. They explain better.</p>
<p>And to explain better, we need to rethink how we can show SEO value is created and how it’s measured. This isn’t a hot take anymore.</p>
<p>As Yordan Dimitrov pointed out, SEO isn’t dying, but discovery is changing fast and shifting user behavior. Early-stage users increasingly get what they need directly inside search experiences.</p>
<p>That means clicks, specifically, are no longer a reliable proxy for value. So, if we keep optimizing and reporting as if they are, we’re creating a picture that no longer matches reality.</p>
<p>But I’m not saying we should replace every SEO metric overnight. What we report does need to reflect how growth decisions are made.</p>
<p>If everything you track sits at the top of the funnel, you don’t have a measurement strategy; you have a visibility tracker. A simple way out is to separate signals from outcomes:</p>
<p>These tell you if your SEO efforts can function at all.</p>
<p>Necessary. Not sufficient.</p>
<p>These tell you whether users actually care.</p>
<p>Still not the end goal, but much closer.</p>
<p>This is where people usually get nervous.</p>
<p>If none of these are visible, SEO efforts are always going to be questioned.</p>
<p>First, you audit what you’re already reporting. Most of it will sit in operational metrics, and that’s normal.</p>
<p>Then, you should map pages to funnel stages. It doesn’t have to be perfect, but it should be honest.</p>
<p>Then you can add one or two outcome-level metrics that make sense for your model. For example:</p>
<p>If organic conversion rates are far below benchmarks (for example, industry benchmarks place B2B ecommerce conversion rates at 1.8%), that’s not a “traffic problem.” It’s a mismatch between intent, content, and expectations.</p>
<p>Over time, you can rebalance reporting. I recommend not deleting old metrics immediately; they will let you show people how they correlate (or don’t) with outcomes. That’s how trust is built.</p>
<p>In practice, most teams don’t jump from rankings to revenue overnight. Measurement maturity tends to move in layers, with each step making the next one easier to defend.</p>
<p>Changing measurement systems is more psychological than most teams expect. People don’t like KPI changes because it feels safe to own the same old things. And to be honest, revenue attribution feels messier than rankings; that’s why it creates resistance and people avoid it.</p>
<p>The way around this isn’t better dashboards. It’s framing. Instead of saying “we’re changing KPIs,” you can think and say: “For the next eight weeks, we’re testing if organic sessions on these pages generate demo requests.”</p>
<p>The goal isn’t to drown stakeholders in methodology, but to give just enough context to replace metric comfort with experimental clarity, so they understand what’s being tested, why it matters, and how success will be judged.</p>
<p>So, basically, make it an experiment, and define success upfront. Then, share learnings even when results are uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We don’t need complex stacks. We only need cleaner thinking. And we need to revisit KPIs regularly to remove ones that no longer help, add new ones when priorities change, and document why decisions were made.</p>
<p>First, you can start by explaining that while rankings were reliable growth proxies in 2020, AI search and zero-click results have broken that connection. Use visual stories comparing high-traffic/low-conversion paths against low-traffic/high-conversion alternatives to illustrate why KPI evolution matters.</p>
<p>For most mid-market teams, a pragmatic measurement stack is sufficient: GA4 or an alternative, a CRM with clean attribution fields, a visualization layer like Looker Studio, and a core SEO platform. Complexity should be added only as measurement maturity increases.</p>
<p>Finally, we should treat measurement as a living system. For this, I recommend running quarterly KPI reviews to retire unused metrics, adding new ones aligned with evolving priorities, and documenting hypotheses behind major initiatives for later validation.</p>
<p>When measurement evolves continuously, SEO strategy can evolve alongside search itself.</p>
<p>Anthony Barone puts this well: When teams rely on surface-level metrics, they lose a stable way to judge progress. SEO then becomes easy to deprioritise every time a new platform or AI narrative shows up.</p>
<p>Value-driven metrics change the conversation. SEO stops being “traffic work” and starts being part of growth discussions.</p>
<p>The SEOs who will do well aren’t the ones with the cleanest ranking reports. They’re the ones who can calmly explain how organic search contributes to real business outcomes, even when the numbers aren’t perfect.</p>
<p>That starts with questioning every metric you report and being honest about which ones still earn their place.</p>
