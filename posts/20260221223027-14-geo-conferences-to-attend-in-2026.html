<p>Now, it commands its own conference circuit, operating alongside dozens of dozens of established SEO and marketing conferences that have added substantial AI search tracks.</p>
<p>Here’s a roundup of all the GEO and GEO-adjacent conferences that are happening in 2026.</p>
<p>Date: February 19</p>
<p>Location: San Francisco, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: Applicated-based attendance</p>
<p>Website: https://aeoconf.com/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Glen Coates (OpenAI), Vanessa Thompson (Twilio), Tim Sanders (G2), Ethan Smith (Graphite), Rob Gaige (Reddit), Guy Yalif (Webflow), Kady Srinivasan (Freshworks)</p>
<p>AEO Conf is where the magic happens: marketing leaders from top companies gathering to share actual playbooks (not just theory!) for winning visibility when AI answers questions.</p>
<p>If, for example, you want to know how Webflow doubled their signups from LLMs, this is your chance to hear it straight from them.</p>
<p>Date: March 18-20</p>
<p>Location: Paris, France</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From €300</p>
<p>Website: https://seo-summit.com/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Neil Patel (NP Digital), Si Quan Ong (Ahrefs), Dawn Anderson (Berley), Itamar Blauer (Whitepress), Olivier Duffez (Ranking Metrics), Mikaël Priol (SEO.fr)</p>
<p>France’s biggest SEO &amp; GEO event is now in its most ambitious edition yet, held at the legendary Parc des Princes stadium in Paris.</p>
<p>This is where France’s top SEO minds gather to tackle the massive shift from traditional search to AI-powered discovery.</p>
<p>The tagline says it all: brands need to master both advanced SEO and GEO to exist across all channels.</p>
<p>With 25+ conference sessions across 3 tracks, a full-day intensive Masterclass, an exclusive Seine cruise networking party, and the option to stay on an actual floating hotel (OFF Paris Seine), this is as premium as French SEO conferences get.</p>
<p>Plus, I’ll be speaking at the event! So come say hi if you’re there.</p>
<p>Location: Sydney, Australia</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $399</p>
<p>Website: https://prosperitymedia.com.au/sydney-seo-conference/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Patrick Stox (Ahrefs), Kevin Indig, Brodie Clark, Aleyda Solis, Destiny Flaherty</p>
<p>Australia’s biggest SEO party, now in its 7th year. The speaker lineup reads like an SEO all-star team: Aleyda Solis, Patrick Stox, Kevin Indig, the works.</p>
<p>They’ve got dedicated sessions on making your content “LLM-ready” and understanding how AI is reshaping organic growth. Sydney in March is also wildly pleasant, just saying.</p>
<p>Date: April 14–16</p>
<p>Location: Lisbon, Portugal</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From €700</p>
<p>Website: https://digitalmarketingcon.eu/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: David White, Chris Kubby, Felix Beilharz, Martin Greif</p>
<p>International, AI-first marketing conference in beautiful Lisbon. The whole vibe here is “how do we make our brands LLM-ready?”</p>
<p>Meaning, how do you get ChatGPT and Gemini to recommend you? Great mix of strategy and execution, plus you get to eat pastéis de nata between sessions.</p>
<p>Date: April 27-30</p>
<p>Location: New York City, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $1,099</p>
<p>Website: seoweek.org</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Michael King (iPullRank), Crystal Carter (Wix), Wil Reynolds (Seer Interactive), Ross Simmonds (Foundation), Jori Ford (FoodBoss)</p>
<p>Four immersive days in NYC organized by iPullRank, and widely regarded as the premier AI+SEO conference.</p>
<p>Each day has its own theme, from technical foundations to user psychology to future trends. The final day (“The Future”) is all about GEO/AEO and what’s coming next. Michael King’s “Brave New World of SEO” keynote alone is worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>40+ speakers, including a Principal PM from Microsoft AI talking about how search engines actually work under the hood.</p>
<p>Date: April 30 - May 1</p>
<p>Location: Brighton, UK</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From £430</p>
<p>Website: https://brightonseo.com/events/april-2026</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Chima Mmeje (Moz), Gus Pelogia (Indeed), Dan Taylor (SALT), Priya Verma (Compare the Market)</p>
<p>The absolute biggest search marketing conference on the planet. Two full days of talks from world-leading experts, and this year they’re going hard on how AI search engines are changing everything.</p>
<p>Sessions on “SEO and AI Agents,” automation, and how ChatGPT/Perplexity are reshaping the fundamentals. There’s also a free ticket ballot if you’re lucky.</p>
<p>Location: Singapore</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $339</p>
<p>Website: ahrefsevolve.com/singapore</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Tim Soulo (Ahrefs), Sasha Gusain (Canva), Robert Lai (Kaliber), Charlotte Ang (Traffic Bees), Dan Petrovic (DEJAN), James Norquay (Prosperity Media)</p>
<p>Think of this as Ahrefs Evolve’s more intimate Asian gathering—same quality insights, more relaxed vibe.</p>
<p>We bring together a tight-knit community of SEO pros and marketers who genuinely want to figure out how to stay visible when AI is changing everything about search. Singapore’s an amazing city to network in (incredible food scene doesn’t hurt), and the conversations here tend to be refreshingly direct. You’ll walk away with practical strategies for AI search discoverability, not just theoretical frameworks.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s significantly more accessible price-wise than flying to San Diego.</p>
<p>Location: San Francisco, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $349</p>
<p>Website: https://www.demandandexpand.com/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Bruno Estrella (Clay), Sonal Mane (Databricks), Vanessa Thompson (Twilio), Katie Peters (SauceLabs)</p>
<p>San Francisco’s answer to “what happens when AI meets marketing at scale?”</p>
<p>This is being billed as the largest AI + Marketing conference in SF, and they’re tackling the hard questions: How do you measure attribution when there are no clicks? How do AEO and GEO actually work? How do you build demand in a world where AI answers questions before users visit your site?</p>
<p>Location: Washington DC, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $725</p>
<p>Website: https://www.geo-conference.com/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: TBA</p>
<p>The self-proclaimed official GEO conference, and honestly? We can give it to them. 20+ talks across two tracks (one for marketers, one for the technical crowd), limited to just 200 people so you actually get to network without fighting through crowds.</p>
<p>Oh, and no recordings allowed, so you have to be in the room. The goodie bag is legendary ($25K+ in tools and credits), and there’s a sunset yacht party on the Potomac afterward. If you’re serious about GEO, this is your Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Location: New York City, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $749</p>
<p>Website: moz.com/mozcon/register-mozcon-2026</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Lily Ray (Amsive), Josh Spilker (AirOps), Wil Reynolds (Seer Interactive), Bianca Anderson (hims, hers)</p>
<p>Moz’s flagship single-day conference in NYC: one track, 20+ speakers, about 600 people who all genuinely care about SEO. Last year’s MozCon featured Lily Ray’s legendary session “GEO, AEO, LLMO: Separating Fact from Fiction,” which basically everyone in the industry references now.</p>
<p>This year’s call for speakers explicitly asked for talks on AI search visibility and building AI workflows. Focused, high-signal content without the overwhelming mega-conference chaos.</p>
<p>Date: September 15-16</p>
<p>Location: San Diego, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $600</p>
<p>Website: https://brightonseo.com/events/san-diego-2026</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Andy Crestodina (Orbit Media Studios), Brie E Anderson (BEAST Analytics), Chantal Maddocks (United Airlines), Chris Long (Nectiv), Cindy Krum (MobileMoxie)</p>
<p>BrightonSEO crosses the pond! This is the US edition of the world’s biggest search conference, bringing all that brightonSEO energy to San Diego.</p>
<p>Focus on AI-powered search, what’s happening with Google’s AI Overviews, and practical technical SEO. Workshops available if you want hands-on learning. Plus, San Diego in September is pretty much perfect weather.</p>
<p>Date: September 16–18</p>
<p>Location: Boston, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $1,199</p>
<p>Website: https://www.inbound.com/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: TBA</p>
<p>This is HubSpot’s massive flagship conference. one of the biggest marketing, sales, and CX gatherings on the planet.</p>
<p>INBOUND 2025 had a major AEO session and actually launched AEO content tools through HubSpot’s Breeze AI platform, so 2026 is expected to go even deeper on AI agents, AI-driven personalization, and optimizing for AI search.</p>
<p>If you work in inbound marketing and haven’t been to INBOUND yet, what are you even doing?</p>
<p>Location: Berlin, Germany</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: TBA</p>
<p>Website: https://www.geoknowhow.com/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: Nadine McNulty (Claneo), Johannes Beus (SISTRIX), Tamara Heinz (MediaMarktSaturn), Peter Hartmann (Henkel)</p>
<p>Germany’s first (and only!) conference dedicated entirely to GEO, and yes, it’s all in German.</p>
<p>If you’re in the DACH region and want to understand how to make your brand pop up in ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity answers, this is your home game. Second year running, organized by the smart folks at Claneo.</p>
<p>Date: October 12-13</p>
<p>Location: San Diego, USA</p>
<p>Ticket Prices: From $899</p>
<p>Website: https://ahrefsevolve.com/</p>
<p>Notable Speakers: TBA</p>
<p>This is our flagship — four days where we bring together 600+ people from 35+ countries who are all wrestling with the same existential question: how do we stay discoverable when AI is eating our clicks? The theme is deliberately honest: “staying discoverable in search, AI, and beyond.”</p>
<p>We’re not pretending the old playbook still works. In 2025, almost every conversation came back to AI: LLMs as search platforms, AI Overviews decimating traffic, and what the hell we’re supposed to do about it. 2026 looks even more intense.</p>
<p>The speaker lineup isn’t just names on a website; these are practitioners actively solving these problems in the wild. The All-Access pass gets you into a yacht mixer with the speakers before they’re mobbed by everyone else, genuinely one of the best networking opportunities in SEO.</p>
<p>San Diego in October is perfect weather, the venue is walkable to everything, and honestly? The vibe is less “corporate conference” and more “let’s figure this out together.” Group discounts available if you’re bringing your team.</p>
